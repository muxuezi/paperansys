Title: A novel approach to improve the efficacy of tumour ablation during cryosurgery  
Author(s): Ramajayam, KK (Ramajayam, Krishna Kumar); Kumar, A (Kumar, Amitesh) 
Source: CRYOBIOLOGY  Volume: 67  Issue: 2  Pages: 201-213  DOI: 10.1016/j.cryobiol.2013.06.013  Published: OCT 2013   
Abstract: Freezing tumours and ablating it using cryosurgery is becoming a popular surgical procedure for treatment of carcinomas. In order to improve the efficiency of the cryosurgical procedure different approaches have been implemented till now, e.g., injecting high thermal conductivity fluid inside the tumour, low latent heat fluids inside the tumour prior to cryosurgery etc. These techniques improve the cryosurgical process to some extent but lack in minimising the damage to the surrounding healthy tissues. In this study, a novel concept is proposed which advocates the use of solutions with specific thermophysical properties around the interface of tumour. Numerical modelling has been done to determine the location of the ice fronts in the presence of this solution around the boundary of the tumour. It is noticed that in the presence of solution layer, owing to its distinct thermophysical properties like low thermal conductivity, not only the cellular destruction is enhanced but also the damage to the surrounding healthy tissue is minimised. Further, results indicate that this strategy leads to a faster ablation rate reducing the surgical time immensely. Also, an optimal offset, the minimum distance between the tip of cryoprobe and the boundary of the tumour, is identified for a given tumour radius with a given active length which gives maximum tumour necrosis in less time. This optimal offset which has been identified for each case will help the surgeons in proper planning of cryosurgery and improving the effectiveness of this technique greatly, making it a better treatment modality than its counterparts in many ways. It is also observed that for a 2 mm increase in activelength of the cryoprobe, the decrease in optimal offset is approximately 1 mm, i.e. optimal offset decreases linearly with an increase in the activelength for a given radius of the tumour. Also, for tumour with different radii, ranging between 10 mm to 15 mm, with same active length, the time taken for complete ablation by the larger tumour is nearly 2.7 times the time taken by the smaller one for every 2.5 mm increase in the tumour radius.

Title: Fundamental experiments and numerical investigation of cryo-freezing incorporating vascular network with enhanced nano-freezing  
Author(s): Chua, KJ (Chua, K. J.) 
Source: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES  Volume: 70  Pages: 17-31  DOI: 10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2013.03.019  Published: AUG 2013   
Abstract: Structural blood networks and blood perfusion rate of a tumor impact the manner in which cryosurgery is carried. In locations where complex vascular systems exist, the freezing temperature of the cryoprobes must account for these additional heat sources while maximizing the eradication of cancer cells. In this study, a computational cryo-freezing model that incorporates a simplified mathematical description of the vascular morphology has been constructed. Complex vascular network with varied blood flows were simplified and modeled as tree-like branched fractal network. The present work evolved a simplified and time-saving methodology to accurately simulate complex blood vessel network in order to reduce simulation tediousness and computational cost. A thermal freezing algorithm has been employed to generate transient temperature profiles, to visualize isotherms in the anatomical region of interest and to provide essential information the ice-front propagation. Extensive experimental validation of the proposed model has been performed with good agreement of up to 4.3%. Effects of combining cryosurgery with advanced nanotechnology to better regulate ice-ball development within a biological tissue were quantitatively investigated. Depending on the thermal properties of different nanoparticles, they could either enhance heat conduction or retard freezing to minimize unintended cryoinjury to the neighboring tissue. Hence, key results have confirmed that while certain nanoparticles act as therapeutic freezing agents that promote cryoablation, others are capable of protecting surrounding healthy tissue.

Title: Alternative cooling and heating as a novel minimally invasive approach for treating obesity  
Author(s): Sun, ZQ (Sun, Zi-Qiao); Yang, Y (Yang, Yang); Liu, J (Liu, Jing) 
Source: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES  Volume: 64  Pages: 29-39  DOI: 10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2012.08.003  Published: FEB 2013   
Abstract: Patients with obesity often suffer pain and risks arising from complications in their pursuit for a trimmer figure. Therefore, an effective and safe treatment for obesity is urgently needed. In this paper, we propose a novel minimally invasive way to treat the target obesity tissues via alternative cooling and heating produced by a microprobe. The validity of the method was evaluated through both numerical simulation and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments. Theoretical prediction presents the significant effect of typical surgery and assesses the influence of various temperature boundary conditions on the microprobe to obtain the ideal therapeutic effect. An estimation standard was also established on the basis of cryolipolysis and hyperthermia. The DSC test confirms physical and chemical changes in cells during the cooling and heating process. The treatment planning will be varied with operational target, such as longer or shorter treatment time, one or multiple probes, etc. The 3D reconstruction employing MATLAB shows a simulated destruction area. This work is expected to serve as the foundation for identifying a new cure for obesity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Title: RECENT ADVANCES IN MODELING AND COMPUTING THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL BIOHEAT TRANSFER WITH PHASE CHANGE IN CRYOSURGICAL ABLATION OF TUMOR TISSUES  
Author(s): Deng, ZS (Deng, Zhong-Shan); Liu, J (Liu, Jing)

Abstract: Numerical simulation for bioheat transfer problems with phase change has significant applications in planning cryosurgical treatment of tumor. A detailed knowledge of temperature distributions around the target tumor tissues is critical for designing and administrating an optimum cryosurgery. However, many critical issues such as the moving boundaries in a computational domain due to a phase change, large amount of computer time for predicting the entire temperature field, irregularities in tissue structures, existence of discrete large blood vessels, nonlinearity of the bioheat transfer model, etc. significantly pose difficulties with numerical simulation. This review is devoted to providing an overview of several numerical strategies which have special flexibility and generality in dealing with part of the above issues in three-dimensional cases. The strategies include the effective heat capacity method, finite difference method, and the dual reciprocity boundary element method including parallel computing modality, etc. for solving phase change problems. They are applied in treating cryosurgical ablation of tumor tissues with blood flow in large vessels. The prospects and possible challenges for numerical simulation of bioheat transfer problems with phase changes are also discussed. The numerical algorithms outlined in this review could help in developing treatment planning software which may be used in clinical cryosurgery at no distant future.

Abstract: Cryosurgery is a surgical technique that employs freezing to destroy target tumor tissue. While the main objective during a cryosurgical procedure is to ensure tissue destruction within the cryolesion, the greatest challenge is how to spare the surrounding healthy tissues from cryoablation. In this work, a historical review of the field of cryosurgery is presented followed by a theoretical study where a mathematical model is developed for cryosurgery on a basal cell carcinoma (BCC) using liquid nitrogen (LN2) spray. The model takes into consideration the anatomic structure of skin tissue and the irregular geometry of BCC. In particular, a methodology for quantitatively determining the extent of the intracellular ice formation (IIF) zone based on the tissue temperature and cooling rate (CR) is proposed, which can directly relate to the necrosis of the cancer cells after cryosurgery. The model is then used to analyze formation of the IIF zone during cryosurgery on a BCC and quantification is provided for the volume of the final IIF zone. A parametric study is also carried out to investigate the effect of various protocol parameters on the final IIF zone. The results should be useful for dermatologists for pre-treatment surgery planning.

Title: Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of properties of phase change micro/nanoparticles for thermal protection during cryosurgery

Abstract: Based on our previous study which tested the feasibility of protecting the healthy tissue around the cancerous tissue during cryosurgery by microencapsulated phase change materials (PCMs) with large latent heat and low thermal conductivity, uncertainties and sensitivities for thermal protection efficiency caused by the deviations of the PCM properties' values, the PCMs concentration and the distance between the PCMs domain and the tumor domain were further investigated in this study. The preliminary results showed that the radius of the micro/nano PCM particle, the upper and lower phase transition temperatures of the PCM and the distance between the PCMs domain and the tumor domain should be accurately measured before performing thermal protection by PCMs during cryosurgery. Less than 20 % deviations of the heat capacities of solid and liquid PCM almost had no obvious influence on the thermal protection efficiency. The results obtained in this study will further help us to optimize the protection protocol by PCMs before performing cryosurgery.

Abstract: In this study, a new method for thermal protection by microcapsulated phase change micro/nanoparticles during hyperthermia was proposed and a three-dimensional theoretical model was developed to test the feasibility of this method. Effective capacity method was used to get the transient temperature distribution in cancerous tissue embedded with superparamagnetic nanoparticles and healthy tissue embedded with phase change materials (PCMs). The results indicated that embedding micro/nano PCMs can decrease the healthy tissue temperature and has no obvious influence on the temperature in cancerous tissue under the same heating condition, which can help protect the healthy tissue during hyperthermia. The influences of the domain, concentration, latent heat, and the lower and upper phase transition temperatures of the PCM on the thermal protection efficacy were also further analyzed in detail. This study may open a new technical approach for enlarging application of hyperthermia.

Title: HEATING EFFECT OF THERMALLY SIGNIFICANT BLOOD VESSELS IN PERFUSED TUMOR TISSUE DURING CRYOSURGERY

Abstract: The purpose of this work is to evaluate the heating effect of thermally significant blood vessels (TSBVs) during cryosurgery process. A theoretical model is developed to describe the heat transfer of perfused tissue containing a 6 mm-radius tumor and a countercurrent artery-vein pair in the vicinity of the tumor. The novelty of the model is that both the Pennes bio-heat transfer equation and the energy transport equation are used to govern the heat transfer of perfused tumor tissue and the heat convection and diffusion of the blood flow. The explicit finite different method is used to solve the transient equations with the second boundary condition set for the boundary of both the blood vessels and the tissue. The results indicate that the heating effect of the blood on the tissue surrounding the countercurrent artery-vein pair may cause parts of the tumor to be insufficiently frozen for a pre-designed cryosurgery protocols, and which may lead to regeneration of the tumor cells. A quite important issue has been raised by this study, i.e., the cryosurgery protocols should be carefully designed with full attention being paid to the heating effect of TSBVs in case of a countercurrent artery-vein pair in the vicinity of the tumor.

Title: In Vivo Experiments and Numerical Investigations on Nanocryosurgical Freezing of Target Tissues with Large Blood Vessels  
Author(s): Sun, ZQ (Sun, Zi-Qiao); Yang, Y (Yang, Yang); Liu, J (Liu, Jing) 
Source: JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL NANOTECHNOLOGY  Volume: 8  Issue: 1  Pages: 10-18  DOI: 10.1166/jbn.2012.1362  Published: FEB 2012   
Abstract: This study presented the first in vivo animal experiments of using nano-cryosurgical modality to completely freezing tumor tissues embedded with large blood vessels, which is a tough issue to tackle otherwise. Three-dimensional theoretical simulations were also performed on the complex freezing problems by considering flow and heat transfer of blood flow in large vessels. According to the experimental measurements and numerical predictions, injecting the nanoparticles with high thermal conductivity into the freezing target can significantly reduce the heating effect of blood vessel, shorten the freezing time, and enlarge the freezing range. Most importantly, the introduction of nanoparticles successfully overcomes the classical challenges in completely ablating the tumor region with large blood vessel and enhancing the freezing efficacy of cryosurgery. This investigation consolidates the practical and theoretical foundation for nano-cryosurgery which suggests a highly efficient freezing strategy for treating late stage tumor.

Abstract: In this study, a novel combined therapy of nano-cryosurgery and RF induced nano-hyperthermia was proposed, with the purpose of improving tumor treatment efficacy. To better understand the mechanisms of enhancement on freezing and heating by introducing magnetic nanoparticles with high thermal conductivity during the combined therapy of nano-cryosurgery and RF hyperthermia, a series of numerical investigations were performed. The results indicate that the combined therapy of nano-cryosurgery and RF hyperthermia can serve as an applicable way to flexibly control the size and shape of lethal freezing/heating areas, which will help selectively ablate the target tissue and then optimize the thermal treatment process for tumor.

Abstract: Recently, nano-cryosurgery was proposed to improve freezing efficiency of the conventional cryosurgery. As is well known, the effect of thermally significant large blood vessel on temperature has long been a research focus for conventional cryosurgery, since the warm blood flowing through large vessel may result in insufficient freezing and tumor residual. However, there is little information concerning the effects of large vessels on the temperature distribution and freezing lesion in nano-cryosurgery. In this study, two typical vascular models were applied to investigate the effects of large blood vessels to the thermal distribution and freezing lesion during nano-cryosurgery. The numerical results indicated that, after localized introduction of nanoparticles, large vessels embedding in tumor tissues can be totally frozen during cryosurgery and thus the insufficient freezing region surrounding large vessels can be effectively eliminated. The results also suggested that adjuvant use of nanoparticles is expected to serve as a promising method to tackle the deficiency in conventional freezing of tumors with large blood vessels in future oncological clinics.

Abstract: The bioheat transfer with phase change in biological tissues during the freezing process is simulated by the dual phase lag conduction heat transfer model. A numerical algorithm based on the enthalpy method is established to solve the solidification of biological tissues. The linearly temperature-dependent enthalpy (non-isothermal phase change) is considered here. The results of the parabolic heat conduction model for a slice of cucumber are compared with the experimental data. A comparison between dual phase lag and hyperbolic solutions with small values of relaxation times is applied in order to verify the corresponding parabolic solutions accuracy of the dual phase lag and hyperbolic solutions. The heating source effect owing to blood perfusion and metabolic heat on the heat transfer in a biological tissue subject to freezing process is studied. The relaxation time has an important influence on the transient temperature and temperature gradient. A major discrepancy among bioheat transfer models is found for zones closer to the cooling boundary. The heat source term, owing to blood flow and metabolism in a phase change problem in the biological tissue, has a significant influence on thermal effects of the subject tissue.

Abstract: Although considerable progresses have been made in cryosurgery to treat tumor, thermal injury to collateral structures is still a known complication of cryosurgery. In this study, a new method was proposed to prevent the healthy tissue around the cancerous tissue from thermal injury by microencapsulated phase change micro/nanoparticles, in which the phase change materials (PCMs) with large latent heat and low thermal conductivity are microencapsulated by liposome and delivered to the healthy tissue by mainline, arterial injection, hypodermic injection or direct injection. The three-dimensional transient temperature field in human body containing one tumor and embedded PCMs in the surrounding healthy tissue was numerically studied. The effects of the PCMs concentration, the phase change temperature, the temperature range near the phase change point, the latent heat and the PCMs distribution (especially the number of sides that PCMs cover, and the distance between the PCMs domain and the cancerous domain) were further discussed. The computational analysis showed that embedding PCMs in the healthy tissue around the cancerous tissue can significantly reduce the cryoinjury to the surrounding healthy tissue. The result also suggested that not embedding the PCMs directly adjacent to the cancerous tissue will help to improve the protection efficacy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A mathematical model for phase change heat transfer in cryosurgery was established. In this model, a fractal tree-like branched network was used to describe the complicated geometrical frame of blood vessel. The temperature distribution and ice crystal growth process in biological tissue including normal tissue and tumor embedded with two cryoprobes were numerically simulated. The effects of cooling rate, initial temperature and distance of two cryoprobes on freezing process of tissue were also studied. The results show that the ice crystal grows more rapidly in the initial freezing stage and then slows down in the following process, and the pre-cooling of cryoprobes has no obvious effect on freezing rate of tissue. It also can be seen that the distance of 10 mm between two cryoprobes is the most appropriate choice for operation effect in the range of operating conditions presented in this study

Abstract: Cryotherapy is a prospective green method for malignant tumor treatment. At low temperature, the cell viability relates with the cooling rate, temperature threshold, freezing interface, as well as ice formation. In clinical applications, the growth of ice ball must reach a suitable size as cells could not be all killed at the ice periphery. The cell death ratio at the ice periphery is important for the control of the freezing destruction. The mechanisms of cryoinjury around the ice periphery need thorough understanding. In this paper, a primary freeze-thaw control was carried out in a cell culture microchip. A series of directional freezing processes and cell responses was tested and discussed. The temperature in the microchip was manipulated by a thermoelectric cooler. The necrotic and apoptotic cells under different cryotreatment (duration of the freezing process, freeze-thaw cycle, postculture, etc.) were stained and distinguished by propidium iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-Annexin V. The location of the ice front was recorded and a cell death boundary which was different from the ice front was observed. By controlling the cooling process in a microfluidic channel, it is possible to recreate a sketch of biological effect during the process of simulated cryosurgery.

Abstract: Methods of predicting temperature profiles during local hyperthermia treatment are very important to avoid damage to healthy tissue. With this aim, fundamental solutions of Pennes' bioheat equation are derived in rectangular, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates. The medium is idealised as isotropic with effective thermal properties. Temperature distributions due to space- and time-dependent heat sources are obtained by the solution method presented. Applications of the fundamental solutions are addressed with emphasis on a particular problem of Magnetic Fluid Hyperthermia (MFH) consisting of a thin shell of magnetic nanoparticles in the outer surface of a spherical solid tumour. It is observed from the solution of this particular problem that the temperature profiles are strongly dependent on the distribution of the magnetic nanoparticles within the tissue. An almost uniform temperature profile is obtained inside the tumour with little penetration of therapeutic temperatures to the outer region of healthy tissue. The fundamental solutions obtained can be used to develop boundary element methods to predict temperature profiles with more complicated geometries.

Abstract: The derivation and application of the general characteristics of bioheat transfer for medical applications are shown in this paper. Two general bioheat transfer characteristics are derived from solutions of one-dimensional Pennes' bioheat transfer equation: steady-state thermal penetration depth, which is the deepest depth where the heat effect reaches: and time to reach steady-state, which represents the amount of time necessary for temperature distribution to converge to a steady-state. All results are described by dimensionless form; therefore, these results provide information on temperature distribution in biological tissue for various thermal therapies by transforming to dimension form.

Abstract: In clinics, the minimally invasive freezing therapy, commonly known as cryosurgery, has been increasingly used for the controlled destruction of tumor tissue. However, there are still many bottlenecks to impede the success of a cryosurgery. One of the most critical factors has been that insufficient or inappropriate freezing will not completely destroy the target tumor tissues, which as a result may lead to tumor regenesis and thus failure of treatment. In addition, the surrounding healthy tissues may suffer from serious freeze injury due to unavoidable release of a large amount of cold from the freezing probe. To resolve these challenges, we recently proposed a new strategy, termed as nano-cryosurgery, to improve freezing efficiency of the conventional cryosurgical procedure. The basic principle of this protocol is to deliver functional suspension of nanoparticles with favorable physical and/or chemical properties into the target tissues, which then serve as adjuvant or drug carrier either to maximize the freezing heat transfer process, regulate freezing scale, modify ice-ball formation orientation or prevent the surrounding healthy tissues from being frozen. In addition, introduction of nanoparticles during cryosurgery could also help better image the edge of a tumor as well as the margin of the iceball. The new therapy raised many critical fundamental as well as practical issues for solving. This review is dedicated to present a comprehensive review on multiscale fundamental phase change heat transfer issues thus involved. Attentions would span from micro-scale heat transfer in cellular scale to tissue level. Some related thermal physical effects of nanoparticles on the freezing process such as ice nucleation enhancement, water transport during freezing of a single cell will be discussed. Cryosurgical thermal management of using nanoparticles to modify thermal properties of the tissue-particle components, regulate the growth orientation and strength of an ice ball, enable a conformal tumor destruction in tissues with or without large blood vessels, etc. will be illustrated. Meanwhile, the fundamental issue for the transport of nanoparticle and its assisted drug delivery will be summarized. Theoretical modeling as well as experimental approaches for studying the micro/nano-scale heat transfer throughout the tissue or cell domain during nano-cryosurgery will be suggested. Some potential applications and possible challenges when nanotechnology meets cryosurgery will be outlined. The nano-cryosurgery is expected to help expand the boundary of the emerging frontier of nano-biomedical engineering.

Title: Simulation of heat transfer of biological tissue during cryosurgery based on vascular trees  
Author(s): Shi, J (Shi, Juan); Chen, ZQ (Chen, Zhenqian); Shi, MH (Shi, Mingheng) 
Source: APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING  Volume: 29  Issue: 8-9  Pages: 1792-1798  DOI: 10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2008.08.014  Published: JUN 2009   
Abstract: During the freezing process in cryosurgery, the blood flow and blood perfusion have great influence on the heat transfer of the biological tissue. The effect of blood vessels on the temperature distribution of biological tissue is studied in this paper. The blood vessels are assumed as vascular trees using fractal methods. The method is based on the calculation of the 'fractal dimension' of blood vessels, considering the parameters of blood vessels and blood flows. The biological tissue is assumed as porous media and a numerical model of phase change heat transfer in biological tissue is established. The temperature distribution in biological tissue considering the effect of blood flow is simulated. The effect of the geometry of the vascular tree on the phase change heat transfer in biological tissue during cryosurgery is also analyzed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title: Numerical study on freezing-thawing phase change heat transfer in biological tissue embedded with two cryoprobes

Source: JOURNAL OF CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY  Volume: 16  Issue: 2  Pages: 326-331  DOI: 10.1007/s11771-009-0055-x  Published: APR 2009   
Abstract: A two-dimensional model for freezing and thawing phase change heat transfer in biological tissue embedded with two cryoprobes was established. In this model, the blood vessels were considered as tree-like branched fractal network, and the effective flow rate and effective thermal conductivity of blood were obtained by fractal method. The temperature distribution and ice crystal growth process in biological tissue embedded with two cryoprobes during freezing-thawing process were numerically simulated. The results show that the growth velocity of ice crystal in freezing process from 200 to 400 s is more rapid than that from 400 to 600 s. Thawing process of frozen tissue occurs in the regions around cryoprobes tips and tissue boundary simultaneously, and the phase interfaces are close to each other until ice crystal melts completely. The distance of two cryoprobes has a more profound effect on the temperature distribution in freezing process at 400 s than at 800 s.

Title: Characterization of the nanocryosurgical freezing process through modifying Mazur's model

Abstract: Nanoparticles enhanced freezing, termed as nanocryosurgery, is a newly emerging cryosurgical technique which has potential advantage in targeted tumor treatment. However, there are currently no models available to predict the effects of nanoparticles on cell-level biophysical events during cryosurgery. Here, we present a theoretical model through modifying Mazur's equation and ice nucleation theory to predict the kinetic course of the target cell such as water transport and ice nucleation during nanocryosurgical process. The transient temperature response of the target cell, which was a major influential variable of the model, was calculated by coupling the Pennes bioheat equation and the thermal conductivity model of nanoparticle-fluid mixture. With the model, the freezing effect of nanocryosurgical process on target cell at varying distances from cryoprobe can be comprehensively characterized from micro- to macroscale. Parametric studies revealed that the kinds of nanoparticles and their extracellular volume fraction are two important factors to affect cell-level freezing response compared with other factors such as the cell radius and intracellular volume fraction of nanoparticles. The corresponding sensitivity analysis of various parameters is also reported. This study would help to better understand the role of nanoparticles in the freezing process and benefit to optimize the protocol of tumor treatment when nanocryosurgery is administrated.

Abstract: The aim of the recently proposed nano cryosurgery is to exactly kill all tumor cells within the target region, which is defined by the characters of the tissues, such as bulk feature, shape, type and so on. It is easy to see that nano particles play a very critical role in cryosurgery. However, the amounts of nano particles could be loaded generally differ significantly due to variation of different tissue structures. This is particularly true for tumors situated at or surrounding some important organs. Therefore, treatment planning and understanding tissue temperature responses during a nano cryosurgery is rather important for the success of such innovated therapy. This study is dedicated to evaluate the temperature responses of different tissue types when subjected to cryosurgery by adjuvant use of nano particles. It was shown that for each organ, individuation must be considered for controlling the cooling dose in a nano cryosurgery in order to avoiding negative effect. Mechanisms coming from the diverse porosity, water content, density, blood perfusion, thermal conductivity, specific heat, and so on for each tissue were preliminarily interpreted.

Abstract: Cryosurgery is a surgical procedure in which the malign or benign tumors are destroyed by application of cold. Heat transfer during cryosurgery is a complex phenomenon involving phase change and is affected by blood flow dynamics and thermophysical properties of tissue. In this paper we present heat transfer modeling and simulation studies by incorporating the temperature dependence of the blood flow, and blood and tissue properties and effect of metabolic heat generation on heat transfer process. We have also considered the heat transfer inside the cryoprobe tip to set the boundary conditions for the freezing front propagation studies. The simulation results will be useful for better understanding of the heat transfer process in blood perfused tissues during cryosurgery and in designing cryosurgical devices.

Abstract: The ultimate aim of cryosurgery is to exactly kill all tumor cells within a closely defined region. For this purpose, we recently proposed an effective approach to perform conformal cryosurgical treatment of tumors by adjuvant use of nanoparticles. Such a nanoparticle-enabled cryosurgical modality is termed as nano-cryosurgery. In this study, the uncertainties for the predicted temperatures of tissues in nano-cryosurgery due to approximate parameters were investigated. Contributions of uncertainties from the tissue area permeated with nanoparticles, the concentration of nanoparticles, and the thermal parameters of tissues were respectively analyzed, and the uncertainty limits for temperature distributions in these cases were also estimated. The uncertainty analysis presented in this study is expected to serve as a significant guide for performing a highly efficient and also completely safe nano-cryosurgical treatment.

Title: Nano-cryosurgery: A basic way to enhance freezing treatment of tumor

Abstract: Cryosurgery is a minimally invasive clinical technique with controlled destruction of target tissues through a specifically administrated freezing procedure. This method has now been used in a wide variety of clinical situations such as treatment of skin cancers, glaucoma, lung and prostate tumor etc. However, there still exist many bottle necks to impede the success of a cryosurgery. A most critical factor has been that insufficient or inappropriate freezing will not completely destroy the target tumor tissues, which as a result may lead to tumor regenesis and thus failure of treatment. Meanwhile, the surrounding healthy tissues may suffer from serious freeze injury due to unavoidable release of a large amount of cold from the freezing probe. To resolve this difficulty, we proposed an innovative strategy, termed as nano-cryosurgery, to significantly improve freezing efficiency of a conventional cryosurgical procedure. The basic principle of this protocol is to inject functional solution with nano particles into the target tissues, which then serves as either to maximize the freezing heat transfer process, regulate freezing scale, modify ice-ball formation orientation or prevent the surrounding healthy tissues from being frozen. Meanwhile, introduction of nanoparticles during cryosurgery could also help better image the edge of a tumor as well as the margin of the iceball. Along this direction, several progresses have been made on mechanism interpretation, theoretical modeling, numerical prediction, conceptual experimental demonstration and treatment planning etc. in the authors' tab. This study is dedicated to present a preliminary outline on the nano-cryosurgery by summing up the aspects as mentioned above. The evident merits and shortcomings of the nano cryosurgery will be illustrated. Some potential feasibility, versatile applications and possible challenges when nanotechnology meets cryosurgery will be pointed out. It is expected that the concepts of nanocryosurgery may suggest new opportunities for realizing a highly safe, targeted and accurate freezing therapy in future tumor clinics.

Abstract: A numerical model was developed to study heat transfer process during freezing of biological tumors. Two different cryosurgical systems, Endocare cryoprobe and novel combined cryosurgery and hyperthermia system, were investigated using the multidimensional, finite element method (FED) developed in Ansys (V7.0) by us recently. The tissues were modeled as nonideal materials, the thermophysical properties of which were temperature dependent. The enthalpy method was applied to solve the highly nonlinear problem. It was found that for the same initial/boundary conditions and the same target tissues, the novel combined cryosurgery and hyperthermia system could supply the target tissue an approximate cooling rate, a much lower minimal temperature, a much greater warming rate, and a much greater thermal gradient as compared with the Endocare cryoprobe system. The numerical simulation results indicated that the novel combined cryosurgery and hyperthermia system could provide an excellent curative effect in the corresponding cryotherapy.

Abstract: Cryosurgery has been recently accepted as a treatment option for eradicating undesirable tissues, especially tumor tissues, due to its minimally invasive nature and low hospitalization needs. A multidimensional, finite element analysis (FEA) for the cooling, holding and rewarming processes of biological tissues during cryosurgery is presented. The tissues were treated as non-ideal materials with temperature dependent thermophysical properties. The enthalpy method has been applied to solve the non-linear problem. The influence of heating effect due to blood flow and metabolism was studied, and furthermore, the effect of pre-injecting solutions with particular thermal properties into the target tissues was also numerically studied. It was found that the heat source term due to blood flow and metabolism in the bioheat transfer equation has a significant influence on the thermal and thermal gradient histories of the target tissues, and that the method of injection of solutions with particular thermal properties into the target tissues before cryosurgery may be a possible way to optimize the treatment process. However, in vitro experiments have not fully supported this viewpoint. (c) 2006 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The features of heat transfer in a multiprobe cryosurgery system have been studied. Numerical simulations show that the use of a heater to control the shape of the region of cryogenic action leads to a sharp increase in the temperature gradient and, hence, in the level of mechanical stresses. The results are highly sensitive to the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity. In solving heat-exchange problems, it is necessary to take into account the structure of biological tissues and make allowance for a significant inhomogeneity of the thermal load of cryoprobes.

Abstract: A model is presented to simulate the cooling processes during tumor cryosurgery with different kinds of flows through the cryoprobe. The heat flux between the cryoprobe wall and the tumor, the heat transfer coefficient under different inflow conditions are obtained numerically. The impact of the inlet mass flow rate, gas volume fraction on these parameters is investigated. It is found that the heat transfer coefficient decreased significantly when inflow changed from two-phase annular flow to droplet flow, and to gas flow. The inlet gas volume fraction and flow velocity only significantly affect the freezing ability of the probe when the inflow is gas or in droplet phase. Simulation of the tumor temperature profiles under different flow conditions show that the heat transfer coefficient is a crucial parameter in temperature prediction during cryosurgery. Results indicate that when the cryoprobe wall is assumed at a constant temperature conventionally, the cooling effect could be overestimated. It would be more reasonable to use the constant wall heat transfer coefficient to simulate the cooling progress under a specific flow.

Abstract: A multidimensional, finite element analysis (FEA) for the freezing, holding, rewarming and heating processes of biological tissues during the cryosurgery process of the new Combined Cryosurgery/Hyperthermia System is presented to theoretically test its validity. The tissues are treated as nonideal materials freezing over a temperature range, and the thermophysical properties of which are temperature dependent. The enthalpy method is applied to solve the highly nonlinear problem. It was found that when the same boundary condition and the same target tissue presented, the novel Cryosurgery/Hyperthermia System could supply the target tissue an approximative cooling rate, a much lower minimal temperature, a much greater warming rate, and a much greater thermal gradients compared with that of the simplified Endocare system. The numerical simulation indicates that the novel combined cryosurgery and hyperthermia system can provide an excellent curative effect in the corresponding cryotherapy. And the most attractive feature of this FEA framework is that it can be easily mastered by the surgeon without in-depth theory of heat transfer to analyze the cryosurgery process beforehand due to the friendly GUI (graphical user interface) of Ansys software.

Title: Practical considerations for maximizing heat production in a novel thermobrachytherapy seed prototype  
Author(s): Gautam, B (Gautam, Bhoj); Warrell, G (Warrell, Gregory); Shvydka, D (Shvydka, Diana); Subramanian, M (Subramanian, Manny); Parsai, EI (Parsai, E. Ishmael)

Abstract: Purpose: A combination of hyperthermia and radiation in the treatment of cancer has been proven to provide better tumor control than radiation administered as a monomodality, without an increase in complications or serious toxicities. Moreover, concurrent administration of hyperthermia and radiation displays synergistic enhancement, resulting in greater tumor cell killing than hyperthermia and radiation delivered separately. The authors have designed a new thermobrachytherapy (TB) seed, which serves as a source of both radiation and heat for concurrent brachytherapy and hyperthermia treatments when implanted in solid tumors. This innovative seed, similar in size and geometry to conventional seeds, will have self-regulating thermal properties. 
Methods: The new seed's geometry is based on the standard BEST Model 2301 I-125 seed, resulting in very similar dosimetric properties. The TB seed generates heat when placed in an oscillating magnetic field via induction heating of a ferromagnetic Ni-Cu alloy core that replaces the tungsten radiographic marker of the standard Model 2301. The alloy composition is selected to undergo a Curie transition near 50 degrees C, drastically decreasing power production at higher temperatures and providing for temperature self-regulation. Here, the authors present experimental studies of the magnetic properties of Ni-Cu alloy material, the visibility of TB seeds in radiographic imaging, and the ability of seed prototypes to uniformly heat tissue to a desirable temperature. Moreover, analyses are presented of magnetic shielding and thermal expansion of the TB seed, as well as matching of radiation dose to temperature distributions for a short interseed distance in a given treatment volume. 
Results: Annealing the Ni-Cu alloy has a significant effect on its magnetization properties, increasing the sharpness of the Curie transition. The TB seed preserves the radiographic properties of the BEST 2301 seed in both plain x rays and CT images, and a preliminary experiment demonstrates thermal self-regulation and adequate heating of a tissue-mimicking phantom by seed prototypes. The effect of self-shielding of the seed against the external magnetic field is small, and only minor thermal stress is induced in heating of the seeds from room temperature to well above the seed operating temperature. With proper selection of magnetic field parameters, the thermal dose distribution of an arrangement of TB and hyperthermia-only seeds may be made to match with its radiation dose distribution. 
Conclusions: The presented analyses address several practical considerations for manufacturing of the proposed TB seeds and identify critical issues for the prototype implementation. The authors' preliminary experiments demonstrate close agreement with the modeling results, confirming the feasibility of combining sources of heat and radiation into a single thermobrachytherapy seed.

Abstract: Magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) therapy uses the magnetic component of electromagnetic fields in the radiofrequency spectrum to couple energy to magnetic nanoparticles inside tumors. In MFH therapy, magnetic fluid is injected into tumors and an alternating current (AC) magnetic flux is applied to heat the magnetic fluid-filled tumor. If the temperature can be maintained at the therapeutic threshold of 42 degrees C for 30 minutes or more, the tumor cells can be destroyed. Analyzing the distribution of the magnetic fluid injected into tumors prior to the heating step in MFH therapy is an essential criterion for homogenous heating of tumors, since a decision can then be taken on the strength and localization of the applied external AC magnetic flux density needed to destroy the tumor without affecting healthy cells. This paper proposes a methodology for analyzing the distribution of magnetic fluid in a tumor by a specifically designed giant magnetoresistance (GMR) probe prior to MFH heat treatment. Experimental results analyzing the distribution of magnetic fluid suggest that different magnetic fluid weight densities could be estimated inside a single tumor by the GMR probe.

Title: Statistical modeling of electrode based thermal therapy with Taguchi based multiple regression  
Author(s): Jamil, M (Jamil, Muhammad); Ng, EYK (Ng, E. Y. K.)

Abstract: In this research the effect of physical predictors for the electrode based thermal therapy were considered and their effect on the final achieved temperature was quantified. For this purpose 6 predictors that may affect the temperature were studied. Knowledge of temperature inside the domain determines the extent of thermal damage in the domain. For the particular case of electrode based thermal therapy, a prediction model based on the regression analysis can be of immense importance in providing a quick and cost effective way to predict approximate temperature that would be achieved inside the computational domain. The regression model based on the physical predictors in an ideal situation can eradicate the need to solve complex electro-thermal equations for the prediction of temperature. In the first phase, a multiple regression model assuming a linear relationship between six independent variables and maximum achieved temperature as dependent variable or response was considered to best fit the observed values. A dummy variable was incorporated in the model to categorize the data for tissue and tumor. It was observed that multiple linear regression model could explain 82% of the variation in the observed data. In order to obtain a better prediction model, regression diagnostics were carried out and a modified model was obtained catering to the inherent nonlinear dependence of response variable on some variables. It was concluded that for electrode based thermal therapy improved regression model provided a marked improvement in terms of reliability of prediction over the original multiple linear regression model. Modified model was able to explain approximately 90% of the variation in observed data compared to 82% variation in data explained by the original model. Finally, it was revealed that as opposed to simulation software, the proposed regression model presents itself as being cheap, economical and quick alternative which can provide an estimate of the maximum temperature achievable inside the biological tissue.

Title: To optimize the efficacy of bioheat transfer in capacitive hyperthermia: A physical perspective

Abstract: This paper presents the capacitive hyperthermia from physical perspective focusing on the geometric dimensions as parameters. For this purpose six parameters having three levels each, including two tunable parameters i.e. applied voltage, frequency together with four geometric parameters i.e. size of the tumor, location of the tumor, electrode size and relative position of the electrodes w.r.t tumor were considered for analysis. Taguchi based design of experiments approach was used for the aforementioned six parameters. Using Taguchi's standard 127 orthogonal array, the required results could be obtained employing least number of experiments. For this study temperature was taken as the quality characteristic to be optimized. Furthermore, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to quantify the effect of each parameter on the response variable and results were presented. To deal with the extent of thermal damage to the healthy tissue and tumor, the fraction of tissue experiencing thermal damage was calculated. For this purpose two indices namely treatment index and damage index were formulated. Finally it was concluded that maximum achieved temperature alone does not depict the effectiveness of the treatment. Rather, the combination of the maximum achieved temperature and accompanied thermal damage to the surrounding healthy tissue which should be considered. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title: Evaluation of meshless radial basis collocation method (RBCM) for heterogeneous conduction and simulation of temperature inside the biological tissues  
Author(s): Jamil, M (Jamil, Muhammad); Ng, EYK (Ng, E. Y. K.) 
Source: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES  Volume: 68  Pages: 42-52  DOI: 10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2013.01.007  Published: JUN 2013   
Abstract: In this paper a novel Radial Basis Collocation Method (RBCM) has been applied to investigate the heterogeneous conduction and bioheat transfer problem. RBCM is a strong form meshless method which uses Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation to obtain the solution of the partial differential equation governing the problem under consideration. RBFs hold many advantages like exponential convergence, less dependence on the dimensionality of the problem, ability to deal with complex geometries and ease of implementation, which can be harnessed to one's benefit. Application of RBF interpolation under the framework of RBCM retains its inherent advantages provided that the errors are controlled appropriately. In this research, RBFs have been utilized to solve the steady state heterogeneous conduction and bioheat transfer problem. Approximation function is developed using inverse multiquadratic (IMQ) radial basis functions (RBFs). RBFs are infinitely differentiable functions and have global support. For heterogeneous problem, application of RBF can however become troublesome because of the nonlocality of the RBFs and errors in the domain, interface and boundary can grow large to make the problem unstable. To obtain the exponential convergence, errors at the boundaries, domain and interfaces need to be controlled. Weighted collocation has been used to overcome this problem and retain the inherent properties of the RBFs. RBCM has been successfully applied to solve strong heterogeneous heat conduction and bioheat transfer problem which shows its validity and effectiveness. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Abstract: Objectives: The objective of this study was to develop and test computer algorithms to export micro computed tomography (microCT) images and to generate tumour geometry and specific absorption rate (SAR) distribution for heat transfer simulation in magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia. 
Methods: Computer algorithms were written to analyse and export microCT images of 3D tumours containing magnetic nanoparticles. MATLAB((R)) and ProE((R)) programs were used to generate a prototype of the tumour geometry. The enhancements in the microCT pixel index number due to presence of nanoparticles in the tumours were first converted into corresponding SAR values. The SAR data were then averaged over three-dimensional clusters of pixels using the SAS((R)) program. This greatly decreased the size of the SAR file, while in the meantime it ensured that the amount of total energy deposited in the tumour was conserved. Both the tumour geometry and the SAR file were then imported into the COMSOL (R) software package to simulate temperature elevations in the tumour and their surrounding tissue region during magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia. 
Results: A linear relationship was obtained to relate individual pixel index numbers in the microCT images to the SAR values under a specific magnetic field. The generated prototype of the tumour geometry based on only 30 slices of microCT images resembled the original tumour shape and size. The tumour geometry and the simplified SAR data set were successfully accepted by the COMSOL software for heat transfer simulation. Up to 20(omicron)C temperature elevations from its baseline temperature were found inside the tumours, implying possible thermal damage to the tumour during magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia.

Title: Ranking of parameters in bioheat transfer using Taguchi analysis  
Author(s): Jamil, M (Jamil, Muhammad); Ng, EYK (Ng, E. Y. K.) 
Source: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES  Volume: 63  Pages: 15-21  DOI: 10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2012.07.002  Published: JAN 2013   
Abstract: Modeling bioheat transfer plays an important role in the treatment planning of cancer therapy. Historically, Pennes bioheat equation has been used for bioheat transfer modeling in living tissue because of its simplicity, effectiveness and ease of application. It is imperative that the effect of each parameter involved in the bioheat transfer be known. The ultimate goal of a cancer treatment is to maximize the damage to the cancer affected tissue and minimize the collateral damage to the normal tissue surrounding it. This study takes into account six 3-level factors namely blood perfusion rate in healthy tissue and tumor, frequency, applied voltage, metabolic heating rate in healthy tissue and tumor. The purpose of this study is to rank the parameters involved in electromagnetic heating and determine the factors which affect the bioheat transfer the most. Maximum obtained temperature was taken as the response variable and Taguchi orthogonal arrays were used to obtain required data with minimum number of numerical experiments required. Calculations were performed in Minitab statistical software. The results show that the applied voltage has the largest effect on the maximum achieved temperature followed by frequency of the electromagnetic radiation.

Abstract: The goals of this study are to evaluate in vitro compatibility of magnetic nanomaterials and their therapeutic potential against cancer cells. Highly stable ionic magnetic fluid sample (maghemite, gamma-Fe2O3) and Selol were incorporated into polymeric nanocapsules by nanoprecipitation method. The cytotoxic effect of Selol-loaded magnetic nanocapsules was assessed on murine melanoma (B16-F10) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines following AC magnetic field application. The influence of different nanocapsules on cell viability was investigated by colorimetric MTT 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. In the absence of AC magnetic field Selol-loaded magnetic nanocapsules, containing 100 mu g/mL Selol plus 5 x 10(12) particle/mL, showed antitumoral activity of about 50% on B16-F10 melanoma cells while OSCC carcinoma cells demonstrated drug resistance at all concentrations of Selol and magnetic fluid (range of 100-500 mu g/mL Selol and 5 x 10(12) -2.5 x 10(13) particle/mL). On the other hand, under AC applied fields (1 MHz and 40 Oe amplitude) B16-F10 cell viability was reduced down to 40.5% (+/- 3.33) at the highest concentration of nanoencapsulated Selol. The major effect, however, was observed on OSCC cells since the cell viability drops down to about 33.3% (+/- 0.38) under application of AC magnetic field. These findings clearly indicate that the Selol-loaded magnetic nanocapsules present different toxic effects on neoplastic cell lines. Further, the cytotoxic effect was maximized under AC magnetic field application on OSCC, which emphasizes the effectiveness of the magnetohyperthermia approach.

Title: Theoretical model for thermal protection by microencapsulated phase change micro/nanoparticles during hyperthermia  
Author(s): Lv, YG (Lv, Yonggang); Zou, Y (Zou, Yang); Yang, L (Yang, Li) 
Source: HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER  Volume: 48  Issue: 4  Pages: 573-584  DOI: 10.1007/s00231-011-0907-4  Published: APR 2012   
Abstract: In this study, a new method for thermal protection by microcapsulated phase change micro/nanoparticles during hyperthermia was proposed and a three-dimensional theoretical model was developed to test the feasibility of this method. Effective capacity method was used to get the transient temperature distribution in cancerous tissue embedded with superparamagnetic nanoparticles and healthy tissue embedded with phase change materials (PCMs). The results indicated that embedding micro/nano PCMs can decrease the healthy tissue temperature and has no obvious influence on the temperature in cancerous tissue under the same heating condition, which can help protect the healthy tissue during hyperthermia. The influences of the domain, concentration, latent heat, and the lower and upper phase transition temperatures of the PCM on the thermal protection efficacy were also further analyzed in detail. This study may open a new technical approach for enlarging application of hyperthermia.

Title: Dosimetric and thermal properties of a newly developed thermobrachytherapy seed with ferromagnetic core for treatment of solid tumors  
Author(s): Gautam, B (Gautam, Bhoj); Parsai, EI (Parsai, E. Ishmael); Shvydka, D (Shvydka, Diana); Feldmeier, J (Feldmeier, John); Subramanian, M (Subramanian, Manny) 
Source: MEDICAL PHYSICS  Volume: 39  Issue: 4  Pages: 1980-1990  DOI: 10.1118/1.3693048  Published: APR 2012   
Abstract: Purpose: Studies of the curative effects of hyperthermia and radiation therapy on treatment of cancer show a strong evidence of a synergistic enhancement when both radiation and hyperthermia modalities are applied simultaneously. Varieties of tissue heating approaches developed up to date still fail to overcome such essential limitations as an inadequate temperature control, temperature nonuniformity, and prolonged time delay between hyperthermia and radiation treatments. The authors propose a new self-regulating thermobrachytherapy seed, which serves as a source of both radiation and heat for concurrent administration of brachytherapy and hyperthermia. 
Methods: The proposed seed is based on the BEST Medical, Inc., Seed Model 2301-I-125, where tungsten marker core and the air gap are replaced with a ferromagnetic material. The ferromagnetic core produces heat when subjected to alternating electromagnetic (EM) field and effectively shuts off after reaching the Curie temperature (T-C) of the ferromagnetic material thus realizing the temperature self-regulation. The authors present a Monte Carlo study of the dose rate constant and other TG-43 factors for the proposed seed. For the thermal characteristics, the authors studied a model consisting of 16 seeds placed in the central region of a cylindrical water phantom using a finite-element partial differential equation solver package "COMSOL Multiphysics." 
Results: The modification of the internal structure of the seed slightly changes dose rate and other TG-43 factors characterizing radiation distribution. The thermal modeling results show that the temperature of the thermoseed surface rises rapidly and stays constant around T-C of the ferromagnetic material. The amount of heat produced by the ferromagnetic core is sufficient to raise the temperature of the surrounding phantom to the therapeutic range. The phantom volume reaching the therapeutic temperature range increases with increase in frequency or magnetic field strength. 
Conclusions: An isothermal distribution matching with the radiation isodose distribution can be achieved within a target volume by tuning frequency and intensity of the alternating magnetic field. The proposed combination seed model has a potential for implementation of concurrent brachytherapy and hyperthermia. (C) 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Abstract: In this study, a novel combined therapy of nano-cryosurgery and RF induced nano-hyperthermia was proposed, with the purpose of improving tumor treatment efficacy. To better understand the mechanisms of enhancement on freezing and heating by introducing magnetic nanoparticles with high thermal conductivity during the combined therapy of nano-cryosurgery and RF hyperthermia, a series of numerical investigations were performed. The results indicate that the combined therapy of nano-cryosurgery and RF hyperthermia can serve as an applicable way to flexibly control the size and shape of lethal freezing/heating areas, which will help selectively ablate the target tissue and then optimize the thermal treatment process for tumor.

Abstract: Magnetic nanoparticles with high electrical conductivity have been proved to be effective in enhancing the efficacy of RF ablation. However, the possible carbonization of tissues is an unfavorable factor in achieving greater dimensions of necrosis, because carbonized tissue is a poor conductor, increases impedance and limits propagation area of RF energy. To prevent potential carbonization of tissues surrounding to the heating part of RF electrodes during RF ablation, a new method using ultra-low temperature fluid was proposed for cooling RF electrodes and tissues in the vicinity of RF electrodes in this study. To test its feasibility, the corresponding bioheat transfer process during RF ablation simultaneously applying this cooling method and magnetic nanoparticles was studied through numerical simulations. The results indicate that the cooling method by ultra-low temperature fluid can prevent carbonization of tissues resulted by local high temperature, significantly enlarge the effective heating area and thus actualize highly efficient thermal coagulation to tumor tissues during RF ablation with adjuvant use of magnetic nanoparticles.

Abstract: Although considerable progresses have been made in cryosurgery to treat tumor, thermal injury to collateral structures is still a known complication of cryosurgery. In this study, a new method was proposed to prevent the healthy tissue around the cancerous tissue from thermal injury by microencapsulated phase change micro/nanoparticles, in which the phase change materials (PCMs) with large latent heat and low thermal conductivity are microencapsulated by liposome and delivered to the healthy tissue by mainline, arterial injection, hypodermic injection or direct injection. The three-dimensional transient temperature field in human body containing one tumor and embedded PCMs in the surrounding healthy tissue was numerically studied. The effects of the PCMs concentration, the phase change temperature, the temperature range near the phase change point, the latent heat and the PCMs distribution (especially the number of sides that PCMs cover, and the distance between the PCMs domain and the cancerous domain) were further discussed. The computational analysis showed that embedding PCMs in the healthy tissue around the cancerous tissue can significantly reduce the cryoinjury to the surrounding healthy tissue. The result also suggested that not embedding the PCMs directly adjacent to the cancerous tissue will help to improve the protection efficacy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Electromagnetic field induced by two external electrodes and temperature field resulting from electrode action in the domain of biological tissue being a composition of healthy region and a tumour is considered. To warrant the optimum conditions of tumour destruction, the magnetic nanoparticles are embedded in this region. It is assumed that the temperature which assures an effect of destruction should be higher than 42 degrees C. In this article, the problems relating to the electrodes' electric potential identification and the simultaneous identification of potential and number of nanoparticles introduced to the tumour region are discussed. Additional information necessary to solve the task results from the postulated temperature inside the tumour region assuring its destruction. The problem has been solved using both the gradient method and evolutionary algorithm. The boundary element method is applied to solve the coupled problem connected with the heating of biological tissues.

Title: Using MicroCT Imaging Technique to Quantify Heat Generation Distribution Induced by Magnetic Nanoparticles for Cancer Treatments  
Author(s): Attaluri, A (Attaluri, Anilchandra); Ma, RH (Ma, Ronghui); Zhu, LA (Zhu, Liang) 
Source: JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME  Volume: 133  Issue: 1  Special Issue: SI  Article Number: 011003  DOI: 10.1115/1.4002225  Published: JAN 2011   
Abstract: Magnetic nanoparticles have been used in clinical and animal studies to generate localized heating for tumor treatments when the particles are subject to an external alternating magnetic field. Currently, since most tissue is opaque, the detailed information of the nanoparticle spreading in the tissue after injections cannot be visualized directly and is often quantified by indirect methods, such as temperature measurements, to inversely determine the particle distribution. In this study, we use a high resolution microcomputed tomography (microCT) imaging system to investigate nanoparticle concentration distribution in a tissue-equivalent agarose gel. The local density variations induced by the nanoparticles in the vicinity of the injection site can be detected and analyzed by the microCT system. Heating experiments are performed to measure the initial temperature rise rate to determine the nanoparticle-induced volumetric heat generation rates (or specific absorption rate (SAR W/m(3))) at various gel locations. A linear relationship between the measured SARs and their corresponding microCT pixel index numbers is established. The results suggest that the microCT pixel index number can be used to represent the nanoparticle concentration in the media since the SAR is proportional to the local nanoparticle concentration. Experiments are also performed to study how the injection amount, gel concentration, and nanoparticle concentration in the nanofluid affect the nanoparticle spreading in the gel. The nanoparticle transport pattern in gels suggests that convection and diffusion are important mechanisms in particle transport in the gel. Although the particle spreading patterns in the gel may not be directly applied to real tissue, we believe that the current study lays the foundation to use microCT imaging systems to quantitatively study nanoparticle distribution in opaque tumor.

Abstract: The knowledge of temperature profiles in space and time throughout tumored tissues is a crucial step in designing efficient hyper thermal therapies for cancer. The present work is a contribution in modeling these profiles based on distributions of nanospheres and pointlike particles. Heat diffusion equations are solved under different conditions to rationalize the effects of boundary conditions and size of heating particles. The case of pointlike heating sources is found to be much simpler and more convenient to trace back the effects of metabolism and blood perfusion. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Source: CMES-COMPUTER MODELING IN ENGINEERING & SCIENCES  Volume: 69  Issue: 1  Pages: 43-60  Published: NOV 2010   
Abstract: Heat transfer processes proceeding in domain of heating tissue are discussed. The typical model of bioheat transfer bases, as a rule, on the well known Pennes equation, this means the heat diffusion equation with additional terms corresponding to the perfusion and metabolic heat sources. Here, the other approach basing on the dual-phase-lag equation (DPLE) is considered in which two time delays tau(q), tau(T) (phase lags) appear. The DPL equation contains a second order time derivative and higher order mixed derivative in both time and space. This equation is supplemented by the adequate boundary and initial conditions. To solve the problem the general boundary element method is adapted. The examples of computations for 2D problem are presented in the final part of the paper. The efficiency and exactness of the algorithm proposed are also discussed.

Abstract: The present review is intended to encompass the heat transfer literature published in 2005. While of a wide-range in scope, some selection is inevitable. We restrict ourselves to papers published in English through a peer-review process, with selected translations from journals published in other languages. Papers from conference proceedings generally are not included, though the Proceeding itself may be cited in the introduction. A significant fraction of the papers reviewed herein relates to the science of heat transfer, including experimental, analytical and numerical studies. Other papers cover applications where heat transfer plays a major role, not only in man-made devices but in natural systems as well. The papers are grouped into major subject areas and then into subfields within these areas. In addition to reviewing the literature, we mention major conferences held in 2005, major awards related to heat transfer presented in 2005, and books on heat transfer published during the year.

Abstract: A theory is presented to calculate the heat dissipation of a magnetic suspension, a ferrofluid, driven by7 circularly polarized magnetic field. Theory is tested by in vitro experiments and it is shown that, regardless of the character of the relaxation process, linearly and circularly polarized magnetic field excitations, having the same root-mean-square magnitude, are equivalent in terms of heating efficiency.

Title: Monte-Carlo Simulation on Gold Nanoshells Enhanced Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy on Target Tumor  
Author(s): Wang, X (Wang, Xin); Gao, X (Gao, Xiang); Liu, J (Liu, Jing) 
Source: JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND THEORETICAL NANOSCIENCE  Volume: 7  Issue: 6  Pages: 1025-1031  DOI: 10.1166/jctn.2010.1448  Published: JUN 2010   
Abstract: The laser-induced interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is emerging as a very promising way for minimally invasive treatment on tumor. To realize a highly efficient heating, the gold nanoshells were recently identified as most useful materials to enhance thermal energy deposition of laser in target tissues. However, there is currently a strong lack of understanding the laser energy distribution and the transient temperature field in the tissues due to addition of nanoshells which would seriously impede successful operation of a LITT surgery. This paper is dedicated to present a theoretical modeling on the optical and temperature fields during gold nanoshells enhanced hyperthermia through combining the Monte-Carlo simulation strategy and the Pennes bioheat transfer equation. Effects of size, concentration of the nanoshells to the heating behaviors were evaluated through parametric studies and important conclusions were obtained. The method as developed in the paper would serve well for future treatment planning for the nanoshells enhanced LITT on target tumor tissues.

Author(s): Zablotskii, V (Zablotskii, Vitalii); Lunov, O (Lunov, Oleg); Gomez-Polo, C (Gomez-Polo, Cristina) 
Source: JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY  Volume: 10  Issue: 2  Pages: 690-695  DOI: 10.1166/jnn.2010.1806  Published: FEB 2010   
Abstract: A square array of micron-sized needles containing magnetic nanoparticles has been studied theoretically as potential systems to deliver heat to tumor tissue for the hyperthermia treatment. The spatiotemporal distributions of temperature in a tumor were calculated for different arrays of microneedles. The resulting temperature distributions are found to be more uniform within the tumor target than those caused by other heating systems. Moreover, the temperature profiles could be tuned by a proper choice of the combination of the system parameters: the needle radius, the spatial needles period, as well as the filling fraction and parameters of magnetic nanoparticles.

Title: On the optimal choice of the exposure conditions and the nanoparticle features in magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia  
Author(s): Bellizzi, G (Bellizzi, Gennaro); Bucci, OM (Bucci, Ovidio M.) 
Source: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYPERTHERMIA  Volume: 26  Issue: 4  Pages: 389-403  DOI: 10.3109/02656730903514685  Published: 2010   
Abstract: Purpose: Two points are particularly relevant for the clinical use of magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia: the optimisation of both the exposure conditions and the magnetic nanoparticle characteristics, and the assessment of the limits of scalability of the treatment. To answer these two points a criterion for the individuation of the magnetic field parameters and of the magnetic nanoparticle features that minimise the therapeutic concentration of nanoparticles to be used in magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia is developed. 
Methods: The proposed criterion is based on the estimation of the levels of heat generation rate, due to the electromagnetic field, to be supplied to both the cancerous and the neighbouring healthy tissues for achieving the therapeutic heating of the tumour with a desired degree of spatial selectivity. These quantities are determined by exploiting the Pennes bioheat transfer model. 
Results: The reliability of the criterion has been proven by means of an extensive numerical analysis, performed by considering tumours of spherical shape embedded in tissues of cylindrical shape. Several cases, including tumours of different sizes and position have been considered. 
Conclusions: By exploiting the proposed criterion a study of the clinical scalability of the therapeutic approach is presented.

Abstract: In magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia for cancer treatment, controlling nanoparticle is vital for managing heat deposition and temperature elevations in clinical applications. In this study, we first perform a numerical simulation of magnetic nanofluid transport in agarose gel during an injection process and explore the relationship between the spreading shapes of the nanofluid in gel and injection parameters. We also simulate the nanoparticle concentration distribution in tissues after being injected into the extracellular space under various injection parameters. The model consists of two components. One is a particle trajectory tracking model (PTTM) which can predict the deposition rate of nanoparticle on the porous matrix in a single pore structure by using a Lagrangian Brownian Dynamics simulation method. The other one is a macroscale transport model of nanofluid in saturated porous structures. This study provides advanced understanding of nanofluid transport behavior in a porous structure. Our results show that the gap formed surrounding the needle may cause a back flow and can significantly affect the shape of nanofluid spreading. For small-sized nanoparticle (10nm) with zero surface zeta potential, the filtration effect dominates the particle distribution. The effect of other conditions like nanoparticle size, particle surface coating, and physic-chemical properties of carrier fluid on nanoparticle concentration distribution is under study.

Title: Computational Modeling of Electromagnetically Induced Heating of Magnetic Nanoparticle Materials for Hyperthermic Cancer Treatment

Book Group Author(s): Electromagnet Acad 
Source: PIERS 2010 CAMBRIDGE: PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1 AND 2  Book Series: Progress in Electromagnetics Research Symposium  Pages: 910-914  Published: 2010   
Abstract: We present work on the computational modeling of electromagnetically induced heating in the hyperthermic treatment of cancer using fluid-dispersed magnetic nanoparticles. Magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia can be used as a complement to chemotherapy or for direct targeting and destruction of tumors through heat treatment. The ability of nanoscale materials to provide an extremely localized therapeutic effect is a major advantage over traditional methods of treatment. When an AC magnetic field is applied to a ferrofluid, Brownian rotation and Neel relaxation of induced magnetic moments result in power dissipation. In order to achieve appreciable volumetric heating, while maintaining safe values of frequency and magnetic field strength, and to reduce the risk of spot heating of healthy tissue, it is necessary to determine an ideal range of input parameters for the driving magnetic field as well as the complex susceptibility of the ferrofluid. We do this by the coupling of the solution of Maxwell's equations in a model of the tumor and surrounding tissue as input to the solution to the Pennes' Bioheat Equation (PBE). In this study, we solve both sets of equations via the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method as implemented in the program SEMCAD X (by SPEAG, Schmid & Partner Engineering). We use a multilayer model of the human head made up of perfused dermal and skeletal layers and a grey-matter region surrounding a composite region of tumor tissue and the magnetic nanoparticle fluid. The tumor/ferrofluid composite material properties are represented as mean values of the material properties of both constituents, assuming homogeneity of the region. The AC magnetic excitation of the system (within 100 kHz-2 MHz frequency range) is provided by square Helmholtz coils, which provide a uniform magnetic field in the region of interest. The power density derived from the electromagnetic field calculation serves as an input term to the bioheat equation and therefore determines the heating due to the ferrofluid. Results for several variations of input parameters will be presented.

Title: Quantification of Nanoparticle Distribution in Tissue after Direct Injection Using MicroCT Imaging

Abstract: Magnetic nanoparticles have been used in clinical and animal studies to generate localized heating for tumor treatments when the particles are subjected to an external alternating magnetic field. One approach to deliver the nanoparticles is via directly injecting the nanoparticles in the extracellular space of the tumor. Its advantage is that multiple-site injections can be exploited to cover the entire target region in the case of an irregularly shaped tumor. Currently since most tissue is opaque, the detailed information of the nanoparticle spreading after the injection can not be visualized directly and it is often quantified by indirect methods such as temperature measurements to inversely determine the distribution. In this study, we use a high-resolution microCT imaging system to investigate the nanoparticle concentration distribution in a tissue equivalent agarose gel. The preliminary results are promising to obtain a 3-D distribution of the ferrofluid in tissue. The local density variations induced by the nanoparticles in the vicinity of the injection site can be detected and analyzed by the microCT system. Experiments are performed to study how the injection amount, gel concentration, and nanoparticle concentration in the ferrofluid affect nanoparticle spreading in the gel. The obtained quantified information is important for future studies of temperature elevations in opaque tumor to design optimized treatment protocols.

Abstract: Mathematical modeling of nanobiosystems is an exciting and rapidly growing new field of research that offers the potential to guide and improve technological developments in both nanomedicine and nanobiomaterial science. Unlike the more traditional fields of science and engineering, however, models of nanobiosystems are notoriously complex. In this paper, we highlight some of the primary sources of complexity in nanobiosystems. In particular, we focus on complexity that arises from the inherent nonlinearity of natural systems, noise generated by low copy numbers of relevant biological constituents, heterogeneity that stems from structure in physical systems at the nanoscale, strong coupling between processes that occur at different scales, and the large dimensions necessary to represent typical biological systems. We then suggest how different mathematical modeling techniques are currently being explored and developed to deal with the complicated and computationally demanding problems that can arise when modeling nanobiosystems. Although a relatively new field, mathematical descriptions of nanobiology are becoming increasingly more common and more important for both directing and interpreting experimental studies on nanobiosystems. The goal of this review is to emphasize the challenges associated with modeling nanobiosystems to inspire renewed effort in this highly interdisciplinary, but certainly rewarding, field.

Abstract: Hyperthermia treatment incorporating magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is a hopeful therapy for cancers. Acquiring information about the MNPs' deposition in tumor tissues and modeling magnetic heating in vivo are essential for successful treatment. In this paper, we discuss the inhomogeneous heat generation by MNPs distributed heterogeneously in a liver tumor during arterial embolization hyperthermia (AEH) treatments. In order to more accurately simulate the temperature elevation for an AEH treatment plan, we conducted the following experiments. First, we detected the distribution of magnetic field intensity in the aperture of a ferrite-core applicator. We found that attenuation of the magnetic field focuses mainly on the vertical distance of the aperture, which makes MNPs in tissues have different power loss along the lognitudinal axis. Second, we prepared 20 nm monodisperse lipiodol-soluble MNPs and injected super-selectively through the micro-catheter into the arteries of a rabbit with a VX-2 liver tumor. By histological cuts of the investigated specimen, as well as computed tomography (CT), we found MNPs mainly concentrated on the tumor periphery. Last, from the experimental information, we established a new model for simulating the increasing temperature in the liver tumor based on our inhomogeneous interior-heat-source analysis (IIA). We also compared the simulated results with the two types of homogeneous models. The results showed that IIA gives significantly different results from those for a homogeneous model and thus is preferable when an accurate treatment plan is required during AEH.

Title: Nano-Cryosurgery: Advances and Challenges  
Author(s): Liu, J (Liu, Jing); Deng, ZS (Deng, Zhong-Shan)

Abstract: In clinics, the minimally invasive freezing therapy, commonly known as cryosurgery, has been increasingly used for the controlled destruction of tumor tissue. However, there are still many bottlenecks to impede the success of a cryosurgery. One of the most critical factors has been that insufficient or inappropriate freezing will not completely destroy the target tumor tissues, which as a result may lead to tumor regenesis and thus failure of treatment. In addition, the surrounding healthy tissues may suffer from serious freeze injury due to unavoidable release of a large amount of cold from the freezing probe. To resolve these challenges, we recently proposed a new strategy, termed as nano-cryosurgery, to improve freezing efficiency of the conventional cryosurgical procedure. The basic principle of this protocol is to deliver functional suspension of nanoparticles with favorable physical and/or chemical properties into the target tissues, which then serve as adjuvant or drug carrier either to maximize the freezing heat transfer process, regulate freezing scale, modify ice-ball formation orientation or prevent the surrounding healthy tissues from being frozen. In addition, introduction of nanoparticles during cryosurgery could also help better image the edge of a tumor as well as the margin of the iceball. The new therapy raised many critical fundamental as well as practical issues for solving. This review is dedicated to present a comprehensive review on multiscale fundamental phase change heat transfer issues thus involved. Attentions would span from micro-scale heat transfer in cellular scale to tissue level. Some related thermal physical effects of nanoparticles on the freezing process such as ice nucleation enhancement, water transport during freezing of a single cell will be discussed. Cryosurgical thermal management of using nanoparticles to modify thermal properties of the tissue-particle components, regulate the growth orientation and strength of an ice ball, enable a conformal tumor destruction in tissues with or without large blood vessels, etc. will be illustrated. Meanwhile, the fundamental issue for the transport of nanoparticle and its assisted drug delivery will be summarized. Theoretical modeling as well as experimental approaches for studying the micro/nano-scale heat transfer throughout the tissue or cell domain during nano-cryosurgery will be suggested. Some potential applications and possible challenges when nanotechnology meets cryosurgery will be outlined. The nano-cryosurgery is expected to help expand the boundary of the emerging frontier of nano-biomedical engineering.

Abstract: Detailed knowledge about the temperature distribution achieved in the target area is essential for the development of magnetic hyperthermia treatments. However, the temperature inhomogeneity was found in all local hyperthermia studies. As a consequence of the impossibility of guaranteeing the temperature and thus the thermal dose distribution, hyperthermia is never applied as a single treatment modality. We. suggest a model that enables the calculations and optimization of the spatial-time distribution of the temperature in the target volume (i.e. tumor) caused by magnetically heated elements: (i) arrays of clusters of iron oxides magnetite (Fe(3)O(4)) magnetic nanoparticles, and (ii) arrays of magnetic needles. In order to find the spatial-time temperature distribution in tumor, the bioheat transfer equation is solved for the two above-mentioned arrays of magnetically heated sources embedded in the tumor. The temporal and spatial temperature distributions were calculated with regard to the effect of blood perfusion in the tumor. It is shown that a matrix of magnetic micro-needles injected in the tumor could provide rather uniform tumor heating with the center-edge temperature difference smaller than 3 degrees C at any times during the magnetic hyperthermia treatments. The temperature profiles can be suitably adjusted by a proper choice of the magnetic nanoparticles arrangement.

Abstract: In magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia for cancer treatment, controlling heat deposition and temperature elevations is an immense challenge in clinical applications. In this study, we evaluate magnetic nanofluid transport using agarose gel that has porous structures similar to human tissue by injecting magnetic nanoparticle solution into the extracellular space of gel. The nanofluid distribution in the gel is examined via digital images of the nanofluid spreading in the gel. By adjusting the gel concentration and injection flow rate, the results have demonstrated that a relatively low injection rate leads to a spherically shaped nanofluid distribution in the gels which is desirable for controlling temperature elevations. In parallel to the experimental study, a particle tracking model is developed to study the migration and deposition of nanoparticles in the porous structure under multiple forces including Brownian motion, London-Van der Waals attraction, electrostatic forces, gravitational body force, viscous force, and inertial force. This model allows for the determination of the rate of nanoparticle deposition on the porous structure for various particle sizes, surface potentials, and local fluid velocity. In the future, the information obtained in this study can be used with continuous porous medium theory to predict the evolution of the concentration and deposition profiles of nanoparticles in porous structure during infusion process.

Abstract: This work aimed to analyze the possibility and performance of the temperature controlled hyperthermia based on AC heating of magnetic nanoparticles with low Curie temperature. Temperature dependence of dynamic magnetic susceptibility has been studied experimentally on fine powders of La0.8Ag0.15MnO2.95 in the frequency range of 0.5-2.0 MHz. Critical drop of the AC magnetic losses was found in the vicinity of the Curie point, TC = 42C. The obtained data was used in the numerical analysis of the bioheat equations under typical conditions of the hyperthermia treatment. The mathematical model includes a spherical tumor containing magnetic particles and surrounded by concentric healthy tissue, with account made for the blood perfusion. The calculations performed for various AC power, tumor sizes and doping geometries predict effective autostabilization of the temperature at T TC inside the tumor and steep temperature profile at the interface with the healthy tissue.

Abstract: This study develops and solves two-dimensional convective-conductive coupled partial differential equations based on Pennes' bio-heat transfer model using low Curie temperature nanoparticles (LCTNPs) to illustrate thermal behavior quantitatively within tumor-normal composite tissue by establishing a multi-region finite difference algorithm. The model combines Neel relaxation and temperature-variant saturation magnetization derived from Brillouin Equation and Curie-Weiss Law. The numerical results indicate that different deposition patterns of LCTNP and boundary conditions directly effect the steady state temperature distribution. Compared with high Curie temperature nanoparticles (HCTNPs), optimized distributions of LCTNPs within tumorous tissue scan be used to control the temperature increase in tumors for hyperthermia treatment using an external magnetic field while healthy tissue surrounding it tumor can be kept closer to normal body tissue, reducing the side effects observed in whole body and regional hyperthermia therapy.

Abstract: In magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia for cancer treatment, controlling the heat distribution and temperature elevations is an immense challenge in clinical applications. In this study we evaluate magnetic nanofluid transport and heat distribution induced by commercially available magnetic nanoparticles injected into the extracellular space of biological tissue using agarose gel with porous structures similar to human tissue. The nanofluid distribution in the gel is examined via digital images of the nanofluid spreading in the gel. A radio-frequency electromagnetic field is applied to the gel following the nanofluid injection and the initial rates of temperature rise at various locations are measured to obtain the specific absorption rate (SAR) distribution. By adjusting the gel concentration and injection flow rate, the results have demonstrated that a relatively low injection rate leads to a spherically shaped nanofluid distribution in the gels which is desirable for controlling temperature elevations. The SAR distribution shows that the nanoparticle distribution in the gel is not uniform with a high concentration of the nanoparticles close to the injection site. We believe that the experimental study is the first step towards providing guidance for designing better treatment protocol for future clinical applications.

Abstract: We proposed for the first time a surgical term, the nanocryosurgery, for efficient tumor treatment through combining the theories of cyrosurgery and nanotechnology. Simulations were performed on the combined phase change bioheat transfer problems in a single cell level and its surrounding tissues, to explicate the difference of transient temperature response between conventional cyrosugery and nanocyrosurgery. According to theoretical interpretation and existing experimental measurements, intentional loading of nanoparticles with high thermal conductivity into the target tissues can lower the final temperature significantly, increase the maximum freezing rate, and enlarge the ice volume obtained in the absence of nanoparticles. In addition, introduction of nanoparticle-enhanced freezing could also make conventional cyrosurgery more flexible in many aspects such as artificially interfering in the size, shape, image and direction of iceball formation. The concepts of nanocyrosurgery may offer new opportunities for future tumor treatment. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The boundary element method (BEM) is used to solve the coupled problem connected with the biological tissue heating. The tissue treated as a non-homogeneous domain (healthy tissue and tumor region) is subjected to external electromagnetic field. The thermal effect is produced by electrodes that touches the skin surface. External electromagnetic field generates the internal temperature field, which can be modelled by using the volumetric internal heat sources in the tissue domain (this source function constitutes one of components of the Pennes equation). In the paper, both BEM application to coupled bioheat transfer problems and numerical results of computations are theoretically considered. The successive examples show the different input data determining the electromagnetic field parameters.

Title: An in-vivo experimental study of temperature elevations in animal tissue during magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia  
Author(s): Salloum, M (Salloum, Maher); Ma, RH (Ma, Ronghui); Zhu, L (Zhu, Liang) 
Source: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYPERTHERMIA  Volume: 24  Issue: 7  Pages: 589-601  DOI: 10.1080/02656730802203377  Published: 2008   
Abstract: In magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia in cancer treatment, the local blood perfusion rate and the amount of nanofluid delivered to the target region are important factors determining the temperature distribution in tissue. In this study, we evaluate the effects of these factors on the heating pattern and temperature elevations in the muscle tissue of rat hind limbs induced by intramuscular injections of magnetic nanoparticles during in vivo experiments. Temperature distribution in the vicinity of the injection site is measured inside the rat limb after the nanoparticle hyperthermia. The measured temperature elevations at the injection site are 3.5 1.8C and 6.02 0.8C above the measured body temperature, when the injection amount is 0.1 cc and 0.2 cc, respectively. The full width of half maximum (FWHM) of the temperature elevation, an index of heat transfer in the radial direction from the injection site is found to be approximately 31 mm for both injection amounts. The temperature measurements, together with the measured blood perfusion rate, ambient air temperature, and limb geometry, are used as inputs into an inverse heat transfer analysis for evaluation of the specific absorption rate (SAR) by the nanoparticles. It has been shown that the nanoparticles are more concentrated in the vicinity of the injection site when the injection amount is bigger. The current in vivo experimental studies have demonstrated the feasibility of elevating the tissue temperature above 43C under the experimental protocol and equipment used in this study.

Title: Tumor thermal ablation therapy using alkali metals as powerful self-heating seeds  
Author(s): Rao, W (Rao, Wei); Liu, J (Liu, Jing) 
Source: MINIMALLY INVASIVE THERAPY & ALLIED TECHNOLOGIES  Volume: 17  Issue: 1  Pages: 43-49  DOI: 10.1080/13645700701803826  Published: 2008   
Abstract: The aim of this study is to demonstrate a new tumor thermal ablation therapy, which might lead to a highly economic, safe and efficient heating of target tissues. The alkali metals, usually seen as hazard mediums in daily life, were proposed for the first time as perfect self-heating seeds which can significantly raise the temperature of the tumor tissues. Owing to the tremendous heat released at only the target site during reaction between the metal and the intrinsically existing wet environment of the biological body, the tumor tissues can be efficiently ablated without causing thermal damage to the surrounding healthy tissues. Several conceptual experiments were performed to demonstrate the new thermal ablation principle. Mammary adenocarcinoma cells in culture were found to be quickly destroyed due to the thermal and chemical effects induced by the alkali metal. Further, a significant temperature increase by a magnitude of > 40 degrees C or even combustion has been found easily available at the target site; this temperature increase produces a sufficiently large coagulation and necrosis area within selected areas either for in vitro or in vivo tests. The unique merit of the present thermal ablation therapy is that its remaining reactant can be absorbed by the tissue itself without causing any damage. This study opens possibilities of using the alkali metals to thermally ablate the target tumor in future clinical applications.

Abstract: Magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia attracts growing research interest aiming to develop a localized heating approach for malignant tumors treatment. In this method, magnetic nanoparticles delivered to the tissue or blood vessels induce localized heating when exposed to alternating magnetic field, leading to irreversible thermal damage to the tumor. Controlling the heat distribution and temperature elevation in such treatment is still an immense challenge in clinical applications. In this study, we inject nanofluid into agarose gel to study nanofluid transport in the extracellular space of biological tissue. Nanofluid distribution in the gel is examined via digital images of the nanofluid spreading in the gel. By adjusting gel concentrations and injection flow rates, we expect to identify an idealized particle delivery strategy for achieving spherical shaped nanoparticle dispersion. Thermocouples are then inserted into the gel to measure the initial temperature rises at various locations in the gel to obtain the specific absorption rate (SAR). The preliminary results have demonstrated that a spherical shaped particle deposition is possible with a relatively low injection rate of the nanofluid and a technique that minimizes the air gap surrounding the injection needle. The distribution of energy absorption (SAR) implies that the nanoparticle distribution in the gel is not uniform. High concentration of nanoparticles is observed close to the center of the injection site. Based on the particle deposition pattern, a theoretical model will be developed in the future to simulate the temperature distribution in tissue during nanoparticle hyperthermia treatment. The simulated results will help provide guidance for designing a better treatment protocol in future clinical application.

Abstract: Cryosurgery is a minimally invasive clinical technique with controlled destruction of target tissues through a specifically administrated freezing procedure. This method has now been used in a wide variety of clinical situations such as treatment of skin cancers, glaucoma, lung and prostate tumor etc. However, there still exist many bottle necks to impede the success of a cryosurgery. A most critical factor has been that insufficient or inappropriate freezing will not completely destroy the target tumor tissues, which as a result may lead to tumor regenesis and thus failure of treatment. Meanwhile, the surrounding healthy tissues may suffer from serious freeze injury due to unavoidable release of a large amount of cold from the freezing probe. To resolve this difficulty, we proposed an innovative strategy, termed as nano-cryosurgery, to significantly improve freezing efficiency of a conventional cryosurgical procedure. The basic principle of this protocol is to inject functional solution with nano particles into the target tissues, which then serves as either to maximize the freezing heat transfer process, regulate freezing scale, modify ice-ball formation orientation or prevent the surrounding healthy tissues from being frozen. Meanwhile, introduction of nanoparticles during cryosurgery could also help better image the edge of a tumor as well as the margin of the iceball. Along this direction, several progresses have been made on mechanism interpretation, theoretical modeling, numerical prediction, conceptual experimental demonstration and treatment planning etc. in the authors' tab. This study is dedicated to present a preliminary outline on the nano-cryosurgery by summing up the aspects as mentioned above. The evident merits and shortcomings of the nano cryosurgery will be illustrated. Some potential feasibility, versatile applications and possible challenges when nanotechnology meets cryosurgery will be pointed out. It is expected that the concepts of nanocryosurgery may suggest new opportunities for realizing a highly safe, targeted and accurate freezing therapy in future tumor clinics.

Abstract: Structural and magnetic properties of Mg (x) Zn1-x Fe2O4 powders have been studied with respect to the application for thermal cancer therapy (magnetic hyperthermia). Mg (x) Zn1-x Fe2O4 (x=0.1-0.5) powders with particle sizes between 5 and 8 nm were produced by citrate method. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples correspond to a spinel phase. The lattice constant and the volume of the elementary cell increase when x changes from 0.1 to 0.5. The FTIR-spectra ascertain the spinel phase formation. The Mossbauer studies reveal the presence of extremely small particles, which undergo superparamagnetic relaxation at room temperature. The core-shell model has been applied to explain quadruple doublets. The quadruple splitting at "shells" is bigger than those at "cores" whereas the isomer shifts remain close. Magnetic studies confirm the presence of extremely small particles that behave as superparamagnetic ones. (C) Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Theoretical models are designed to be applied in hyperthermia treatment planning and to help optimize the surgical treatment procedures. However, it is difficult to obtain every physical parameter of the magnetic field in the living tissue in detail, which is necessary for the calculation. We therefore investigated the simulation of thermal distribution in arterial embolization hyperthermia (AEH) stimulated by the external ferrite-core applicator, and measured specific absorption rate (SAR) of magnetic nanoparticles in the maghemtite-gelled composite model. We used fiber optic temperature sensors (FOTS) to measure the values of SAR, which depend on the microstructure and sizes of particles and the intensity and frequency of external ac magnetic field. Detailed tests indicated that the attenuation of magnetic field was mainly focused on the vertical distance in the aperture of the apparatus. We built a simplified cylindrical phantom containing maghemite particles of 20 mn for thermal field simulation on the basis of SAR measurement. The results of simulation indicated that temperature elevation, induced by nanoparticles inside tumors under ac magnetic field, was dose-dependent. The temperature data acquired from the experiment were compatible with the theoretical results, which demonstrated that the current model considering the inhomogenous heat generation could provide accurate and reliable simulation results and a theoretical and technical basis for controlling temperature during AEH therapy.

Title: Minimally invasive thermotherapy method for tumor treatment based on an exothermic chemical reaction

Abstract: In tumor thermotherapy treatment, it is very difficult to achieve the objective of exactly killing the tumor while minimizing the injury of healthy tissues or organs surrounding the tumor. In this study, we describe a new minimally invasive thermotherapy protocol for tumor treatment using heat released from an exothermic chemical reaction, which can safely deliver a totally localized and uniform heating to exactly kill the tumor. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to test the feasibility of this thermotherapy method based on an exothermic chemical reaction. After injection of only a small amount of matched reactants into the target tissue by medical syringes, an exothermic reaction takes place, and then releases tremendous heat to elevate the temperature to its thermally lethal value. Compared with most of the currently existing thermotherapy strategies, this heating is highly localized, completely safe and uniform, which will remarkably reduce the thermal damage and mechanical trauma to the surrounding healthy tissues. This study opens the clinical possibilities for tumors to be treated in a minimally invasive way by a thermotherapy treatment based on an exothermic chemical reaction.

Title: Uncertainties in the micro/nano-particles induced hyperthermia treatment on tumor subject to external EM field  
Author(s): Deng, ZS (Deng, Zhong-Shan); Liu, J (Liu, Jing)

Abstract: Advancement of the recent micro/nano technology has stimulated the renaissance of using magnetic micro/nano particles embedded in biological tissues for the target tumor hyperthermia. As is well known, mathematical solutions of bioheat transfer involved in hyperthermia treatment are indispensable for computerized optimization of hyperthermia parameters. However, estimating the level of uncertainties associated with tissue temperature and thermal ablation area remains a major challenge. In this article, the uncertainties for the predicted temperatures of tissues due to approximate parameters were studied, based on numerical simulation of three-dimensional (3-D) quasi-steady state electromagnetic (EM field and transient temperature response in biological tissues induced by the external EM field. Contributions of uncertainty from the tissue area permeated with micro/nano particles, the concentration and size of micro/nano particles, and the frequency and strength of the external alternating EM field were analyzed, and the uncertainty limits for temperature distributions in these cases were also estimated. The uncertainty analysis presented in this article is expected to serve as a significant guide for performing a highly efficient and also completely safe tumor hyperthermia using magnetic micro/nano particles.

Abstract: This paper is aimed at investigating the capacity of using combined cryosurgical and hyperthermic modality for treating knee bone tumor with complex shape. An anatomical model for human knee was constructed and a three-dimensional (3D) finite element analysis was developed to determine temperature distribution of the tissues subject to single freezing (SF), single heating (SH) and alternate freezing-heating (AFH), respectively. The heat fluxes of the probes wall and the ablation volume are particularly tracked to comparatively evaluate the ablation ability of different probe configurations with varied diameter, number and active working length. As example, an effective conformal treatment strategy via one time's insertion while cyclic freezing-heating using multiple probes is designed for a predefined knee bone tumor ablation. Both SF and SH could create large enough ablation volume, while it is hard for them to perform a conformal treatment on irregular and slender knee tumor. As an alternative, AFH could form a flexible and controlled shape and volume of the ablation by changing the size and number of the probes and adjusting their insertion depth. In addition, a thermal protection method is considered to reduce cryoinjury of the health tissue. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Three probes were fabricated with optimized parameters. Experimental measurements were made in gelatin to validate the simulated results and to demonstrate the probe efficiency.

Title: Alternative cooling and heating as a novel minimally invasive approach for treating obesity

Abstract: Patients with obesity often suffer pain and risks arising from complications in their pursuit for a trimmer figure. Therefore, an effective and safe treatment for obesity is urgently needed. In this paper, we propose a novel minimally invasive way to treat the target obesity tissues via alternative cooling and heating produced by a microprobe. The validity of the method was evaluated through both numerical simulation and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments. Theoretical prediction presents the significant effect of typical surgery and assesses the influence of various temperature boundary conditions on the microprobe to obtain the ideal therapeutic effect. An estimation standard was also established on the basis of cryolipolysis and hyperthermia. The DSC test confirms physical and chemical changes in cells during the cooling and heating process. The treatment planning will be varied with operational target, such as longer or shorter treatment time, one or multiple probes, etc. The 3D reconstruction employing MATLAB shows a simulated destruction area. This work is expected to serve as the foundation for identifying a new cure for obesity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Title: RECENT ADVANCES IN MODELING AND COMPUTING THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL BIOHEAT TRANSFER WITH PHASE CHANGE IN CRYOSURGICAL ABLATION OF TUMOR TISSUES

Abstract: Numerical simulation for bioheat transfer problems with phase change has significant applications in planning cryosurgical treatment of tumor. A detailed knowledge of temperature distributions around the target tumor tissues is critical for designing and administrating an optimum cryosurgery. However, many critical issues such as the moving boundaries in a computational domain due to a phase change, large amount of computer time for predicting the entire temperature field, irregularities in tissue structures, existence of discrete large blood vessels, nonlinearity of the bioheat transfer model, etc. significantly pose difficulties with numerical simulation. This review is devoted to providing an overview of several numerical strategies which have special flexibility and generality in dealing with part of the above issues in three-dimensional cases. The strategies include the effective heat capacity method, finite difference method, and the dual reciprocity boundary element method including parallel computing modality, etc. for solving phase change problems. They are applied in treating cryosurgical ablation of tumor tissues with blood flow in large vessels. The prospects and possible challenges for numerical simulation of bioheat transfer problems with phase changes are also discussed. The numerical algorithms outlined in this review could help in developing treatment planning software which may be used in clinical cryosurgery at no distant future.

Abstract: Cryosurgery is a surgical technique that employs freezing to destroy target tumor tissue. While the main objective during a cryosurgical procedure is to ensure tissue destruction within the cryolesion, the greatest challenge is how to spare the surrounding healthy tissues from cryoablation. In this work, a historical review of the field of cryosurgery is presented followed by a theoretical study where a mathematical model is developed for cryosurgery on a basal cell carcinoma (BCC) using liquid nitrogen (LN2) spray. The model takes into consideration the anatomic structure of skin tissue and the irregular geometry of BCC. In particular, a methodology for quantitatively determining the extent of the intracellular ice formation (IIF) zone based on the tissue temperature and cooling rate (CR) is proposed, which can directly relate to the necrosis of the cancer cells after cryosurgery. The model is then used to analyze formation of the IIF zone during cryosurgery on a BCC and quantification is provided for the volume of the final IIF zone. A parametric study is also carried out to investigate the effect of various protocol parameters on the final IIF zone. The results should be useful for dermatologists for pre-treatment surgery planning.

Abstract: The purpose of this work is to evaluate the heating effect of thermally significant blood vessels (TSBVs) during cryosurgery process. A theoretical model is developed to describe the heat transfer of perfused tissue containing a 6 mm-radius tumor and a countercurrent artery-vein pair in the vicinity of the tumor. The novelty of the model is that both the Pennes bio-heat transfer equation and the energy transport equation are used to govern the heat transfer of perfused tumor tissue and the heat convection and diffusion of the blood flow. The explicit finite different method is used to solve the transient equations with the second boundary condition set for the boundary of both the blood vessels and the tissue. The results indicate that the heating effect of the blood on the tissue surrounding the countercurrent artery-vein pair may cause parts of the tumor to be insufficiently frozen for a pre-designed cryosurgery protocols, and which may lead to regeneration of the tumor cells. A quite important issue has been raised by this study, i.e., the cryosurgery protocols should be carefully designed with full attention being paid to the heating effect of TSBVs in case of a countercurrent artery-vein pair in the vicinity of the tumor.

Abstract: This study presented the first in vivo animal experiments of using nano-cryosurgical modality to completely freezing tumor tissues embedded with large blood vessels, which is a tough issue to tackle otherwise. Three-dimensional theoretical simulations were also performed on the complex freezing problems by considering flow and heat transfer of blood flow in large vessels. According to the experimental measurements and numerical predictions, injecting the nanoparticles with high thermal conductivity into the freezing target can significantly reduce the heating effect of blood vessel, shorten the freezing time, and enlarge the freezing range. Most importantly, the introduction of nanoparticles successfully overcomes the classical challenges in completely ablating the tumor region with large blood vessel and enhancing the freezing efficacy of cryosurgery. This investigation consolidates the practical and theoretical foundation for nano-cryosurgery which suggests a highly efficient freezing strategy for treating late stage tumor.

Abstract: A new probe for tumor treatment is designed and simulated in this study. This probe combines the cryosurgery and hyperthermia which is suitable for the treatment of subcutaneous tumors. Simulations of the cooling and heating processes demonstrate that the probes are capable of treating the tumor effectively. And the numerical results indicate that the lengths of the probe, the diameters of the inner tube and the pressures of liquid nitrogen influence the probes' cooling ability. The temperature responses at the tumor base induced by different probes are similar, though the great differences appear on the treatment interface of the probes, thus the temperature gradient within the tumor. Based on the simulation results, the heating effect of the probe is shown to be effective in damaging the tumor while protecting normal tissue in the surrounding.

Title: Nano-Cryosurgery: Advances and Challenges  
Author(s): Liu, J (Liu, Jing); Deng, ZS (Deng, Zhong-Shan) 
Source: JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY  Volume: 9  Issue: 8  Pages: 4521-4542  DOI: 10.1166/jnn.2009.1264  Published: AUG 2009   
Abstract: In clinics, the minimally invasive freezing therapy, commonly known as cryosurgery, has been increasingly used for the controlled destruction of tumor tissue. However, there are still many bottlenecks to impede the success of a cryosurgery. One of the most critical factors has been that insufficient or inappropriate freezing will not completely destroy the target tumor tissues, which as a result may lead to tumor regenesis and thus failure of treatment. In addition, the surrounding healthy tissues may suffer from serious freeze injury due to unavoidable release of a large amount of cold from the freezing probe. To resolve these challenges, we recently proposed a new strategy, termed as nano-cryosurgery, to improve freezing efficiency of the conventional cryosurgical procedure. The basic principle of this protocol is to deliver functional suspension of nanoparticles with favorable physical and/or chemical properties into the target tissues, which then serve as adjuvant or drug carrier either to maximize the freezing heat transfer process, regulate freezing scale, modify ice-ball formation orientation or prevent the surrounding healthy tissues from being frozen. In addition, introduction of nanoparticles during cryosurgery could also help better image the edge of a tumor as well as the margin of the iceball. The new therapy raised many critical fundamental as well as practical issues for solving. This review is dedicated to present a comprehensive review on multiscale fundamental phase change heat transfer issues thus involved. Attentions would span from micro-scale heat transfer in cellular scale to tissue level. Some related thermal physical effects of nanoparticles on the freezing process such as ice nucleation enhancement, water transport during freezing of a single cell will be discussed. Cryosurgical thermal management of using nanoparticles to modify thermal properties of the tissue-particle components, regulate the growth orientation and strength of an ice ball, enable a conformal tumor destruction in tissues with or without large blood vessels, etc. will be illustrated. Meanwhile, the fundamental issue for the transport of nanoparticle and its assisted drug delivery will be summarized. Theoretical modeling as well as experimental approaches for studying the micro/nano-scale heat transfer throughout the tissue or cell domain during nano-cryosurgery will be suggested. Some potential applications and possible challenges when nanotechnology meets cryosurgery will be outlined. The nano-cryosurgery is expected to help expand the boundary of the emerging frontier of nano-biomedical engineering.

Title: Higher-order coupled and uncoupled analyses of free edge effect in piezoelectric laminates under mechanical loadings  
Author(s): Tahani, M (Tahani, M.); Mirzababaee, M (Mirzababaee, M.) 
Source: MATERIALS & DESIGN  Volume: 30  Issue: 7  Pages: 2473-2482  DOI: 10.1016/j.matdes.2008.10.004  Published: AUG 2009   
Abstract: In this paper, an analytical solution is presented to study the effect of electromechanical coupling on the interlaminar stresses at the free edges of piezoelectric laminated plates. The finite width laminated piezoelectric plates are subjected to uniform axial strain. The equilibrium equations along with the appropriate boundary conditions are obtained by choosing a suitable displacement field based on fourth-order shear-thickness deformation theory and using the principle of minimum total potential energy. The analytical solutions are obtained and the results are compared with those available in the literature. It is found that the interlaminar stresses at the free edges are significantly higher in the coupled case for cross-ply laminates, whereas the coupling effect for symmetric angle-ply laminates is of minor significance.

Abstract: Molecular adjuvants can be used to enhance the natural destructive mechanisms of freezing within tissue. This review discusses their use in the growing field of combinatorial or adjuvant enhanced cryosurgery for a variety of disease conditions. Two important motivations for adjuvant use are: (1) increased control of the local disease in the area of freezing (i.e., reduced local recurrence of disease) and (2) reduced complications due to overfreezing into adjacent tissues (i.e., reduced normal functional tissue destruction near the treatment site). This review starts with a brief overview of cryosurgical technology including probes and cryogens and major mechanisms of cellular, vascular injury and possible immunological effects due to freeze-thaw treatment in vivo. The review then focuses on adjuvants to each of these mechanisms that make the tissue more sensitive to freeze-thaw injury. Four broad classes of adjuvants are discussed including: thermophysical agents (eutectic forming salts and amino acids), chemotherapuetics, vascular agents and immunomodulators. The key issues of selection, timing, dose and delivery of these adjuvants are then elaborated. Finally, work with a particularly promising vascular adjuvant, TNF-alpha, that shows the ability to destroy all cancer within a cryosurgical iceball is highlighted. [DOI: 10.1115/1.3156804]

Abstract: A new system aiming for more effective thermal treatment of tumor is presented in this paper. It facilitates liquid nitrogen (LN2) cooling and radiofrequency (RF) heating in tissue. The bio-heat transfer model has been built to illustrate temperature transients during the treatment, and the induced bio-thermal effects were analyzed at both the tissue and cellular levels. For accurate predictions, the corresponding inactivation energy Delta H of human breast cancer cells (MAD-MB-231) has been obtained through experimental measurements. The results show that through the alternate cooling and heating, the damage region is significantly increased, which cannot be achieved by either the cooling or heating treatment alone.

Abstract: Tumor vasculature damage induced by various thermal treatments has been studied in vivo via laser confocal microscopy. Murine mammary carcinoma 4T1 was implanted in the nude mice dorsal skin fold window chamber. The implanted tumor was treated by alternate cooling and heating. Results showed that the treatment was much more effective as compared with that of cooling or heating alone, especially in damaging the tumor vasculature. In general, tumor vascular response to thermal stimuli was heterogeneous. All the treatments of hyperthermia at 42 degrees C (for 1 h), alternate cooling at 1 degrees C and heating at 42 degrees C (for 1/2 h each) and that of -10 degrees C/42 degrees C (for 1/2 h each) enhanced liposome extravasation. Pre-cooling tumor at 1 degrees C preserved most of the vascular integrity but partially inhibited the effect of post-hyperthermia at 42 degrees C. On the other hand, cooling at -10 degrees C for 1/2 h before heating at 42 degrees C caused severe vessel damage. Histo-pathological analyses further confirmed the effect as rare tumor vessel recurrence and large necrotic tumor tissue areas shown on the 7th day after the treatment.

Title: Disclosure of the significant thermal effects of large blood vessels during cryosurgery through infrared temperature mapping

Abstract: During cryosurgery the large blood vessels entering the frozen volume can be an important source of temperature non-uniformity and possible under-dosage for the target tissues. In this study, the thermal effects of large vessels during cryosurgery were experimentally investigated by introducing infrared thermography system on monitoring both simulated and animal experiments. For all experiments, the freezing was supplied by a 5 mm diameter cryoprobe with liquid nitrogen running through. Tissue temperature responses during freezing and thawing were recorded by an infrared thermography system. It was demonstrated that for different geometrical configurations between the simulated vessels and the positioning of the cryoprobe, a very different temperature profile will be induced even under the same freezing. The results for the cases with single vessel and with count-current vessel pairs indicated that different vascular models produce significantly different temperature responses for a given freezing pattern. Both the simulated and animal experiments suggested that the heating nature of the flowing blood in the large vessels can produce steep temperature gradients and inadequate cooling to the frozen tissues, and therefore may seriously contribute to failed-killing of tumor during cryosurgery. The physical pictures disclosed in this paper may help planning more successful cryosurgery in the near future. (C) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Cryosurgery is a surgical procedure in which the malign or benign tumors are destroyed by application of cold. Heat transfer during cryosurgery is a complex phenomenon involving phase change and is affected by blood flow dynamics and thermophysical properties of tissue. In this paper we present heat transfer modeling and simulation studies by incorporating the temperature dependence of the blood flow, and blood and tissue properties and effect of metabolic heat generation on heat transfer process. We have also considered the heat transfer inside the cryoprobe tip to set the boundary conditions for the freezing front propagation studies. The simulation results will be useful for better understanding of the heat transfer process in blood perfused tissues during cryosurgery and in designing cryosurgical devices.

Abstract: Direct georeferencing has become more and more important in aerial photogrammetry, but the accuracy can't satisfy the requirements at small mapping scales in practical projects. The main reason is that the accuracy of exterior orientation elements determined by the POS is not high enough. According to the theory of space intersection and error propagation law, mathematical model of exterior orientation elements' effects on direct georeferencing based on space intersection proposed firstly. Afterwards, mathematical model of exterior orientation elements' effects on direct georeferencing based on collinearity equations are proposed according to collinearity equations and least square adjustment. The mathematical models are experimented using three sets of actual data at different photographic scales and terrains. Based on the empirical results, the effect rules of exterior orientation elements' errors on direct georeferencing in theory and in practice are analyzed respectively. Finally, effects of different combinations of same accuracies of exterior orientation elements on direct Georeferencing are discussed.

Abstract: Cryosurgery is a minimally invasive clinical technique with controlled destruction of target tissues through a specifically administrated freezing procedure. This method has now been used in a wide variety of clinical situations such as treatment of skin cancers, glaucoma, lung and prostate tumor etc. However, there still exist many bottle necks to impede the success of a cryosurgery. A most critical factor has been that insufficient or inappropriate freezing will not completely destroy the target tumor tissues, which as a result may lead to tumor regenesis and thus failure of treatment. Meanwhile, the surrounding healthy tissues may suffer from serious freeze injury due to unavoidable release of a large amount of cold from the freezing probe. To resolve this difficulty, we proposed an innovative strategy, termed as nano-cryosurgery, to significantly improve freezing efficiency of a conventional cryosurgical procedure. The basic principle of this protocol is to inject functional solution with nano particles into the target tissues, which then serves as either to maximize the freezing heat transfer process, regulate freezing scale, modify ice-ball formation orientation or prevent the surrounding healthy tissues from being frozen. Meanwhile, introduction of nanoparticles during cryosurgery could also help better image the edge of a tumor as well as the margin of the iceball. Along this direction, several progresses have been made on mechanism interpretation, theoretical modeling, numerical prediction, conceptual experimental demonstration and treatment planning etc. in the authors' tab. This study is dedicated to present a preliminary outline on the nano-cryosurgery by summing up the aspects as mentioned above. The evident merits and shortcomings of the nano cryosurgery will be illustrated. Some potential feasibility, versatile applications and possible challenges when nanotechnology meets cryosurgery will be pointed out. It is expected that the concepts of nanocryosurgery may suggest new opportunities for realizing a highly safe, targeted and accurate freezing therapy in future tumor clinics.

Abstract: Recently, a minimally invasive probe system capable of performing both cryosurgery and hyperthermia treatment for deep tumor was developed. With the increasing applications of such combined system, it becomes apparent that without optimal configuration of the multiple probes during multiple freeze/heat cycles, it is difficult produce a conformal lesion in the tumor tissue, which may lead to either insufficient or excessive freezing/heating and consequently, to tumor recurrence or to destruction of healthy tissue. In this study, a comprehensive three-dimensional numerical investigation is performed to design optimal configurations of the multiple probes used in the combined cryosurgical and hyperthermic treatment. The results presented in this study will be useful for treatment planning of the combined cryosurgical and hyperthermic treatment.

Abstract: A numerical model was developed to study heat transfer process during freezing of biological tumors. Two different cryosurgical systems, Endocare cryoprobe and novel combined cryosurgery and hyperthermia system, were investigated using the multidimensional, finite element method (FED) developed in Ansys (V7.0) by us recently. The tissues were modeled as nonideal materials, the thermophysical properties of which were temperature dependent. The enthalpy method was applied to solve the highly nonlinear problem. It was found that for the same initial/boundary conditions and the same target tissues, the novel combined cryosurgery and hyperthermia system could supply the target tissue an approximate cooling rate, a much lower minimal temperature, a much greater warming rate, and a much greater thermal gradient as compared with the Endocare cryoprobe system. The numerical simulation results indicated that the novel combined cryosurgery and hyperthermia system could provide an excellent curative effect in the corresponding cryotherapy.

Abstract: Cryosurgery is a minimally invasive cancer treatment using cryogenic temperatures. Intraoperative monitoring of iceball growth is an advantage of the treatment. However, whereas the iceball can be easily visualized, destruction within the iceball is incomplete and the means to monitor the "kill zone" are urgently needed. Recently, we have shown the ability of tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha) to enhance destruction within an iceball. To avoid systemic toxicity, we delivered TNF-alpha selectively to the tumor by a gold nanoparticle of 30-nm diameter (CYT-6091) tagged with TNF-alpha and thiol-derivatized polyethylene glycol. Using a dorsal skin fold chamber (DSFC) in a nude mouse, both normal skin and human prostate carcinoma (LNCaP Pro 5) were pretreated with soluble TNF-alpha (topically or i.v.) or CYT-6091 (i.v.) and frozen after 4 h. The cryolesion was assessed after 3 days by comparing histologic necrosis with perfusion defects. Hind limb tumors were also treated by visibly encompassing the tumor with an iceball and assessing gross changes over time. A 5-mu g dose of soluble TNF-alpha or CYT-6091 increased the temperature threshold of necrosis in the tumor in the DSFC from -14.0 +/- 1.6 degrees C (n = 6) to 0.9 +/- 1.5 degrees C (n = 6) and -1.5 +/- 3.7 degrees C (n = 6), respectively. In hind limb tumors, the same dose resulted in significant tumor shrinkage and remission in 2 of 8 (for soluble TNF-alpha and in 3 of 8 (for CYT-6091). The nanoparticle alone group without TNF-alpha increased the temperature threshold of necrosis to -7.0 +/- 2.3 degrees C in the tumor in the DSFC and more shrinkage of the tumor in the hind limb when compared with cryo alone treatment. Systemic toxicity was noted in all soluble TNF-alpha groups but none with CYT-6091. These results suggest that it is possible to destroy all of a tumor within an iceball by preincubation with TNF-alpha and systemic toxicity can be avoided by CYT-6091.

Abstract: Successful performance of cryosurgery relies heavily on a quick, efficient, safe and economic imaging way to monitor the surgical advancement and then to evaluate the curative effect. However, there is currently a lack of such an imaging modality. As for the commonly adopted imaging devices such as X-CT, MRI and PET, in addition their high cost and complexity in operation, they often induce additional scathe to the patients due to their potential radiation effects. Besides, in cryosurgery, the most important parameter - temperature - can not be directly detected by these methods. Considering the above factors, infrared thermography (IRT), a rather useful yet often neglected functional imaging technique in clinics, is proposed in this paper as an efficient tool for the quick evaluation and administration of a cryosurgical treatment of tumors. Based on skin surface temperature mapping, the degree of damage to the target tissue site caused by different freezing/heating protocols, as well as the states of blood circulation and metabolic heat generation within the treated region can possibly be identified. Further, through recording the temperature variation feature at the skin surface before and after cryosurgery, IRT would help to quickly evaluate the curative effect, which is very beneficial for later treatment planning. By detecting the surface infrared image and analyzing its digital values, the patient's invisible focus and abnormal physiological states, e.g. inflammations or pneumothorax, often accompanied by cryosurgical output yet difficult to determine via conventional imaging, could also possibly be diagnosed. To test the above concepts, both typical animal and clinical experiments were performed to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of IRT-guided cryosurgery. This study may help push forward a novel, low-cost and non-contact way for an efficient performance of cryosurgery.

Abstract: A multidimensional, finite element analysis (FEA) for the freezing, holding, rewarming and heating processes of biological tissues during the cryosurgery process of the new Combined Cryosurgery/Hyperthermia System is presented to theoretically test its validity. The tissues are treated as nonideal materials freezing over a temperature range, and the thermophysical properties of which are temperature dependent. The enthalpy method is applied to solve the highly nonlinear problem. It was found that when the same boundary condition and the same target tissue presented, the novel Cryosurgery/Hyperthermia System could supply the target tissue an approximative cooling rate, a much lower minimal temperature, a much greater warming rate, and a much greater thermal gradients compared with that of the simplified Endocare system. The numerical simulation indicates that the novel combined cryosurgery and hyperthermia system can provide an excellent curative effect in the corresponding cryotherapy. And the most attractive feature of this FEA framework is that it can be easily mastered by the surgeon without in-depth theory of heat transfer to analyze the cryosurgery process beforehand due to the friendly GUI (graphical user interface) of Ansys software.

Title: Paired immunoglobulin-like receptors and their MHC class I recognition  
Author(s): Takai, T (Takai, T)

Abstract: The immunoglobulin-like receptors provide positive and negative regulation of immune cells upon recognition of various ligands, thus enabling those cells to respond properly to extrinsic stimuli. Murine paired immunoglobulin-like receptor (PIR)-A and PIR-B, a typical receptor pair of the immunoglobulin-like receptor family, are expressed on a wide range of cells in the immune system, such as B cells, mast cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, mostly in a pair-wise fashion. The PIR-A requires the homodimeric Fc receptor common gamma chain for its efficient cell-surface expression and for the delivery of an activation signal. In contrast, PIR-B inhibits receptor-mediated activation signals in vitro upon engagement with other activating-type receptors, such as the antigen receptor on B cells and the high-affinity Fc receptor for immunoglobulin E on mast cells. Recent identification of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules as the physiological ligands for PIR has enabled us to attribute various immunological phenotypes observed in PIR-B-deficient mice to the consequences of the absence of a balanced interaction between PIR and MHC class I molecules expressed ubiquitously. Thus, PIR-A and PIR-B constitute a novel and physiologically important MHC class I recognition system.

Title: Selective freezing of target biological tissues after injection of solutions with specific thermal properties  
Author(s): Yu, TH (Yu, TH); Liu, J (Liu, J); Zhou, YX (Zhou, YX) 
Source: CRYOBIOLOGY  Volume: 50  Issue: 2  Pages: 174-182  DOI: 10.1016/j.cryobiol.2005.01.001  Published: APR 2005   
Abstract: Cryosurgery is a minimally invasive surgical technique that employs the destructive effect of freezing to eradicate undesirable tissues. This paper proposes a flexible method to control the size and shape of the iceball by injecting solutions with specific thermal properties into the target tissues, to enhance freezing damage to the diseased tissues while preserving the normal tissues from injury. The cryosurgical procedure was performed using a minimally invasive cryoprobe cooled by liquid nitrogen (LN2) to obtain deep regional freezing. Several needle thermocouples were applied simultaneously to record the transient temperature to detect the freezing effect on the tissues. Simulation experiments on biological tissue (fresh pork) were performed in vitro and four different liquids were injected into the test materials; these were distilled water, an aqueous suspension of aluminum nanoparticles in water, ethanol, and a 10% solution of the cryoprotective agent dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). The experimental results demonstrate that the localized injection of an appropriate solution could enhance the tumor-killing effect without altering the freezing conditions. The study also suggests the potential value of combining cryosurgery with other therapeutic methods, such as electrical, chemical, and thermal treatments, to develop new clinical modalities in the near future. &COPY; 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Title: Evidences of thermal stress wave induced in deeply frozen biomaterials by a strong and instantaneous heating  
Author(s): Yu, TH (Yu, TH); Liu, J (Liu, J); Zhou, YX (Zhou, YX) 
Source: JOURNAL OF THERMAL STRESSES  Volume: 27  Issue: 12  Pages: 1089-1100  DOI: 10.1080/01495730490498421  Published: DEC 2004   
Abstract: Mechanical stress that develops in biological tissues during freezing and subsequent heating has been identified as an important cause of tissue damage. One such interesting phenomenon is the recently observed concentric ring induced around a probe in biomaterials through alternatively switching between strong freezing and heating. Interpretation of the mechanisms thus involved is critical for the successful operation of combined cryosurgery and hyperthermia on target tumor. To detect the possible stress wave induced in the tissues, an electrode was positioned at a distance far enough from the probe applicator to measure the dynamic low-frequency electrical impedance of the in vitro biological materials (fresh pork and pig liver) subject to strong freezing and heating. It was found that a sudden impedance jump appears in the liquid-phase tissue immediately after the probe freezing was switched to heating; meanwhile, the temperature still remains almost unchanged. Because the magnitude for this impedance jump is so large, and cannot be accounted for by the temperature-dependent effects, it is revealed that a certain shock wave has been produced in the frozen ice ball and is then transmitted into the unfrozen tissues. To theoretically explain the experimental observation, a thermal stress model was applied to characterize the wave feature of the shock stress induced in the strong freezing and heating process. Results obtained in this paper are expected to be significant for better understanding the practices of cryosurgery or cryopreservation.

Title: Numerical simulation of 3-D freezing and heating problems for combined cryosurgery and hyperthermia therapy  
Author(s): Deng, ZS (Deng, ZS); Liu, J (Liu, J) 
Source: NUMERICAL HEAT TRANSFER PART A-APPLICATIONS  Volume: 46  Issue: 6  Pages: 587-611  DOI: 10.1080/10407780490487740  Published: OCT 2004   
Abstract: Recently, a new tumor ablation modality based on freezing immediately followed by a rapid and strong enough heating has been proved to be more effective and flexible than conventional cryosurgery. In this study, a numerical algorithm based on the effective heat capacity method is established to solve three-dimensional (3-D) phase-change problems of biological tissues subject to combined freezing and heating. The accuracy of the numerical code thus compiled is validated through comparisons of the calculation results with a 1-D exact solution for a semi-infinite region solidification problem. Using the present algorithm, comprehensive analysis is performed on the freezing/thawing behavior of biological tissues with tumors. For treatment of large tumors, where strong cooling/heating power is required, a single probe will not be able to address a sufficiently large volume. For this case, freezing/heating problems using a three-probe system are solved for illustration purposes. The present algorithm is expected to be a valuable treatment-planning tool for combined cryosurgery and hyperthermia therapy.

Abstract: Presence of a tumor and its characteristics like location, size and properties are estimated. Estimation is based on the measurement of the skin surface temperature of the breast. Consideration is given to a 2-D breast tissue infected with a tumor. Heat transfer in the breast tissue modeled using the Pennes bioheat equation is solved by the finite volume method. Skin surface temperature profile of the breast is characteristic of the tumor location, its size and grade. In the inverse analysis, the objective function is minimized using the genetic algorithm. Exact estimation is obtained if one parameter is estimated at a time. However, the accuracies are acceptable even when blood perfusion rate, location and size are estimated simultaneously.

Abstract: This article deals with the numerical analysis to ascertain the presence of a tumor and to estimate its size and location in a tissue. Heat transfer in the tissue is modeled using the Pennes bioheat transfer equation, and is solved using the finite volume method. Consideration is given to 1-D brain and breast tissues. Temperature distributions in the tissues are specific to the tumor grades, its locations and sizes, and these are different than that of a normal tissue. With temperature distribution known a priori, estimations of the position and the size of a tumor are done using the inverse analysis. The proposed approach gives a correct estimation of the presence of a tumor and its location and size. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title: A new model of selective photothermolysis to aid laser treatment of port wine stains  
Author(s): Li, D (Li Dong); He, YL (He YaLing); Wang, GX (Wang GuoXiang); Wang, YX (Wang YongXian); Ying, ZX (Ying ZhaoXia) 
Source: CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN  Volume: 58  Issue: 3  Pages: 416-426  DOI: 10.1007/s11434-012-5444-0  Published: JAN 2013   
Abstract: Pulsed dye lasers equipped with cryogen spray cooling (CSC) are now widely used to treat vascular malformation such as port wine stains (PWSs). This paper presents a new integrated model that can quantitatively simulate the cooling of the skin and the heating of the targeted blood vessels in PWSs during laser treatment. The new model is based on the classical homogeneous multi-layer skin model that treats PWS-containing dermis as a mixture of dermal tissue and homogeneously distributed blood. Light propagation in skin and PWSs is simulated by a Monte-Carlo method, which provides accurate description of the light scattering and absorption in the skin. Thermal response of a targeted vessel in the new model is then obtained from the thermal analysis of a Krogh-unit that consists of the vessel and the surrounding dermal tissues and is buried in PWSs. The results from the multi-layer skin model provide appropriate laser influence input as well as the initial thermal condition for the micro-model of the Krogh-unit. A general dynamic relation is also introduced on the surface of skin to quantify the convective cooling of CSC. The model is then applied to dye-laser treatment (wavelength of 585 nm) of PWSs with CSC. Numerical results demonstrate that the present model is able to quantify thermal response of a deeply buried blood vessel in PWSs as a discrete blood vessel does, with a more realistically estimate of the sheltering effect of the dermal tissue (scattering) and blood vessels (absorption) in front of the targeted vessel. To understand the poor response of PWSs in clinic, the thermal characteristics of a targeted vessel was simulated under various conditions. The effects of two morphological parameters, the vessel diameter and the burying depth of the vessel, are then systematically investigated under various pulse durations and fluences of laser. A threshold fluence for given vessel diameter and depth is then estimated quantitatively under the condition of the optimal laser pulse duration. The results indicate that significant high threshold fluence is needed for large vessels buried deeply in the dermis, explaining the physics of the difficulty in clinic of complete clearance of PWSs. The results provide guidance to the clinic selection of the laser pulse duration and laser energy fluence for given PWSs.

Abstract: Laser induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) is a useful method for the treatment of tumors. In order to control the treatment of LITT, a new local control technique has been put forward. A functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system was used. The temperature of biological tissue is regarded as the most important indicator for treatment of LITT. So, the propagations of near infrared laser in normal tumors and liver tumors were simulated with Monte Carlo method. Based on the distribution of light in normal tumors and liver tumors, the temperature distribution inside tissue under laser irradiation has been retrieved. Furthermore, the influences of laser power and action time on the temperature field were studied. The results show that the normal tumors and liver tumors have different light absorption with laser beam. The difference of temperature distribution in tissues with the same laser power is useful to apply in control the treatment of laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy for liver tumors. It is confirmed that the fNIRS can be a useful local control technology for LITT.

Abstract: Analysis of patient images is highly desired for simulating and planning the laser-induced thermotherapy (LITT) to study the cooling effect of big vessels around tumors during the procedure. In this paper, we present an image processing solution for simulating and planning LITT on liver cancer using computed tomography angiography (CTA) images. This includes first performing a 3D anisotropic filtering on the data to remove noise. The liver region is then segmented with a level sets based contour tracking method. A 3D level sets based surface evolution driven by boundary statistics is then used to segment the surfaces of vessels and tumors. Then the medial lines of vessels were extracted by a thinning algorithm. Finally the vessel tree is found on the thinning result, by first constructing a shortest path spanning tree by Dijkstra algorithm and then pruning the unnecessary branches. From the segmentation and vessel skeletonization results, important geometric parameters of the vessels and tumors are calculated for simulation and surgery planning. The proposed methods was applied to a patient's image and the result is shown.

Abstract: The aim of the present study is to perform computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of blood flow in two coronary stents in a realistic three-dimensional geometry under physiological conditions. The two stents, similar to real coronary ones, are both made of 12 rings but are different as far as the positions of the struts are concerned. One type of stent has parallel-connectors and the other transverse-ones. Time variation of the parameters correlated to neo-intimal hyperplasia, such as wall shear stress, magnitude of wall shear stress gradient, and oscillatory shear index are investigated with the conclusion that the stent with parallel-connectors has a better fluid dynamic behavior.

Abstract: The laser-induced interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is emerging as a very promising way for minimally invasive treatment on tumor. To realize a highly efficient heating, the gold nanoshells were recently identified as most useful materials to enhance thermal energy deposition of laser in target tissues. However, there is currently a strong lack of understanding the laser energy distribution and the transient temperature field in the tissues due to addition of nanoshells which would seriously impede successful operation of a LITT surgery. This paper is dedicated to present a theoretical modeling on the optical and temperature fields during gold nanoshells enhanced hyperthermia through combining the Monte-Carlo simulation strategy and the Pennes bioheat transfer equation. Effects of size, concentration of the nanoshells to the heating behaviors were evaluated through parametric studies and important conclusions were obtained. The method as developed in the paper would serve well for future treatment planning for the nanoshells enhanced LITT on target tumor tissues.

Abstract: For late-stage cancer, whole-body hyperthermia (WBH) is highly regarded by physicians as a promising alternative to conventional therapies. Although WBH is still under scrutiny due to potential toxicity, its benefits are incomparable, as diversified devices and very promising treatment protocols in this area are advanced into Phase II and Ill clinical trials. Following the introduction of the WBH principle, this paper comprehensively reviews the state-of-art high-performance WBH devices based on the heat induction mechanisms radiation, convection and conduction. Through analyzing each category's physical principle and heat-induction property, the advantages and disadvantages of the devices are evaluated. Technical strategies and critical scientific issues are summarized. For future developments, research directions worth pursuing are presented in this article.

Title: Simulation of Laser-Induced Thermotherapy Using a Dual-Reciprocity Boundary Element Model With Dynamic Tissue Properties  
Author(s): Zhou, JH (Zhou, Jianhua); Chen, JK (Chen, J. K.); Zhang, YW (Zhang, Yuwen) 
Source: IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING  Volume: 57  Issue: 2  Pages: 238-245  DOI: 10.1109/TBME.2009.2029562  Published: FEB 2010   
Abstract: This paper presents a nonlinear dual-reciprocity boundary element method (DRBEM) for bioheat transfer in laser-induced thermotherapy. The nonlinearity stems from the dynamic changes of tissue thermophysical and optical properties and the blood perfusion rate during laser heating. The proposed DRBEM is coupled with a modified Monte Carlo method and the Arrhenius rate equation to investigate laser light propagation, bioheat transfer, and irreversible thermal damage in tumors. The computer code is justified by comparing the DRBEM results with the finite-difference results. The photothermal processes in interstitial laser thermotherapy with single or double laser fiber scattering applicators are chosen as the demonstrative examples. The dynamic nature, together with the unique advantages of "boundary-only" and excellent adaptability to complex anatomical geometries that the DRBEM method offers, makes the present nonlinear DRBEM a powerful tool for analysis and optimization of the parameters in laser surgical procedure.

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to develop the radiation element method by ray emission method (REM2) code appropriate for coupling with the bioheat transfer equation, and to clarify the photothermal effect of various parameters inside biological tissues.

In order to clarify the effects of optical and thermophysical properties of biological tissues, a one-dimensional tissue model of CW light transport and bioheat transfer is employed. The present study provides nondimensional results, which are obtained by varying refractive index, extinction coefficient, scattering albedo, blood perfusion parameter, and conduction-radiation parameter, show valuable guidance for understanding the coupled light and bioheat transport in tissues.

Abstract: A mathematical model for skin burn injury induced by radiation heating, where the skin was considered to be a 3-D triple-layered structure with embedded three-level dendritic countercurrent vascular network, has been developed. Since there are up to seven levels of arteries and veins, the motivation of this study is to extend the model to a more complex case that considers a seven-level dendritic countercurrent vascular network, where the dimensions and blood flow of the blood vessels are determined based on the constructal theory of multi-scale tree-shaped heat exchangers. The method is illustrated by an example.

A time-resolved Monte Carlo algorithm is developed to investigate transient light propagation in biological tissues with embedded tumors and blood vessels. The results indicate that inclusion of the vasculatures could significantly alter light propagation transients from those obtained from the tissue embedded with tumor only.

Abstract: The aim of this article is to propose a useful scheme, to achieve ideal hyperthermia using spatial heating sources. To do this, the effect of the variation of some of the controllable parameters such as the heating source power, the heating duration, the heating source type, and the cooling system parameters, upon the temperature distribution was investigated. The tissue under treatment is a superficial cancerous tissue with no significant blood vessel. So the Pennes bioheat transfer equation was used to simulate the treatment phenomena. Fully implicit control volume method was used to solve the transient one dimensional Pennes equation. The results show that by selecting appropriate values for controllable parameters, hyperthermia treatment could be done ideally.

Abstract: We modify the Pennes model by taking into account the thermal relaxation time of biological tissue. Specifically, we employ the Maxwell-Cattaneo thermal flux law, in conjunction with the fourth power law, to model the effects of high thermal radiation on such skin. The skin is considered to be a 3D triple-layered structure with embedded dendritic countercurrent multi-level blood vessels, artery and vein, where the dimensions and blood flow of the multi-level blood vessels are determined based on the constructal theory of multi-scale tree-shaped heat exchangers. The method is illustrated by a numerical example. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title: A dual reciprocity boundary element method for photothermal interactions in laser-induced thermotherapy  
Author(s): Zhou, JH (Zhou, Jianhua); Zhang, YW (Zhang, Yuwen); Chen, JK (Chen, J. K.) 
Source: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER  Volume: 51  Issue: 15-16  Pages: 3869-3881  DOI: 10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2008.01.009  Published: JUL 15 2008   
Abstract: Laser-induced thermotherapy (LITT) is a minimally invasive laser hyperthermia procedure for the treatment of localized tumors. Mathematical modeling of the photothermal processes in laser-irradiated tissues is essential for optimal treatment planning. In this study, A Monte Carlo method is introduced to simulate photon transport in the tumor tissues with complex geometries. The dual reciprocity boundary element method (DRBEM) is then formulated to solve the bioheat transfer equation in the tumors. The model is validated with the finite difference solutions. To illustrate the applications of the proposed DRBEM, several laser delivery schemes, including external laser irradiation, single or multiple laser fiber delivery applicators, are studied for tumors with regular or irregular geometric shapes. The temperature transients, laser energy distribution and coagulation patterns for different laser delivery modes are demonstrated. The unique advantages of the DRBEM, such as easy adaptability to complex tumor geometries and no need to discretize the inner domain, may make it well-suited and robust approach for predicting and controlling the temperature evolution in laser-induced thermotherapy procedure.

Title: A numerical model for calculating the vaporization rate of a fuel droplet exposed to a convective turbulent airflow  
Author(s): Al-Sood, MMA (Al-Sood, Maher M. Abou); Birouk, M (Birouk, Madjid) 
Source: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NUMERICAL METHODS FOR HEAT & FLUID FLOW  Volume: 18  Issue: 2  Pages: 146-159  DOI: 10.1108/09615530810846301  Published: 2008   
Abstract: Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a three-dimensional (31)) numerical model capable of predicting the vaporization rate of a liquid fuel droplet exposed to a convective turbulent airflow at ambient room temperature and atmospheric pressure conditions. 
Design/methodology/approach - The 3D Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations, together with the mass, species, and energy conservation equations were solved in Cartesian coordinates. Closure for the turbulence stress terms for turbulent flow was accomplished by testing two different turbulence closure models; the low-Reynolds number (LRN) k-epsilon and shear-stress transport (SST). Numerical solution of the resulted set of equations was achieved by using blocked-off technique with finite volume method. 
Findings - The present predictions showed good agreement with published turbulent experimental data when using the SST turbulence closure model. However, the LRN k-epsilon model produced poor predictions. In addition, the simple numerical approach employed in the present code demonstrated its worth. 
Research limitations/implications - The present study is limited to ambient room temperature and atmospheric pressure conditions. However, in most practical spray flow applications droplets evaporate under ambient high-pressure and a hot turbulent environment. Therefore, an extension of this study to evaluate the effects of pressure and temperature will make it more practical. 
Originality/value - It is believed that the numerical code developed is of great importance to scientists and engineers working in the field of spray combustion. This paper also demonstrated for the first time that the simple blocked-off technique can be successfully used for treating a droplet in the flow calculation domain.

Title: Non-Fourier heat conduction effect on laser-induced thermal damage in biological tissues  
Author(s): Zhou, JH (Zhou, Jianhua); Zhang, YW (Zhang, Yuwen); Chen, JK (Chen, J. K.) 
Source: NUMERICAL HEAT TRANSFER PART A-APPLICATIONS  Volume: 54  Issue: 1  Pages: 1-19  DOI: 10.1080/10407780802025911  Published: 2008   
Abstract: To ensure personal safety and improve treatment efficiency in laser medical applications, one of the most important issues is to understand and accurately assess laser-induced thermal damage to biological tissues. Biological tissues generally consist of nonhomogeneous inner structures, in which heat flux equilibrates to the imposed temperature gradient via a relaxation phenomenon characterized by a thermal relaxation time. Therefore, it is naturally expected that assessment of thermal damage to tissues could be inaccurate when a classical bioheat conduction model is employed. However, little attention has been given to studying the impact of the bioheat non-Fourier effect. In this article, a thermal wave model of bioheat transfer, together with a seven-flux model for light propagation and a rate process equation for tissue damage, is presented to investigate thermal damage in biological tissues. It is shown that the thermal damage assessed with the thermal wave bioheat model may differ significantly from that assessed with the classical bioheat model. Without including the bioheat non-Fourier effect, the assessment of thermal damage to biological tissue may not be reliable.

Title: A thermal-ablation bioheat model including liquid-to-vapor phase change, pressure- and necrosis-dependent perfusion, and moisture-dependent properties  
Author(s): Abraham, JP (Abraham, J. P.); Sparrow, EM (Sparrow, E. M.) 
Source: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER  Volume: 50  Issue: 13-14  Pages: 2537-2544  DOI: 10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2006.11.045  Published: JUL 2007   
Abstract: A new bioheat model is applied to evaluate the use of elevated-temperature thermal therapies for the non-surgical ablation of diseased tissue. The new model is based on the use of the enthalpy method to account for liquid-to-vapor phase change. In addition, the model includes thermophysical property dependence on liquid content and variations of blood perfusion rates dependent on the local necrotic state of the tissue or external pressure applied by the therapy-delivering device. This model is applied here specifically to endometrial ablation for the treatment of menorrhagia. The results of the implementation of the model yielded the depth of tissue necrosis corresponding to a given application of heat at the exposed inner surface of the uterine tissue. These results definitively establish the occurrence of phase change and the complete suppression of perfusion as the major factors governing the necrosis depth. The accounting of moisture-dependent properties had a negligible effect on necrosis. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title: Minimally invasive thermotherapy method for tumor treatment based on an exothermic chemical reaction

Abstract: In tumor thermotherapy treatment, it is very difficult to achieve the objective of exactly killing the tumor while minimizing the injury of healthy tissues or organs surrounding the tumor. In this study, we describe a new minimally invasive thermotherapy protocol for tumor treatment using heat released from an exothermic chemical reaction, which can safely deliver a totally localized and uniform heating to exactly kill the tumor. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to test the feasibility of this thermotherapy method based on an exothermic chemical reaction. After injection of only a small amount of matched reactants into the target tissue by medical syringes, an exothermic reaction takes place, and then releases tremendous heat to elevate the temperature to its thermally lethal value. Compared with most of the currently existing thermotherapy strategies, this heating is highly localized, completely safe and uniform, which will remarkably reduce the thermal damage and mechanical trauma to the surrounding healthy tissues. This study opens the clinical possibilities for tumors to be treated in a minimally invasive way by a thermotherapy treatment based on an exothermic chemical reaction.

Title: Numerical study of sphere drag coefficient in turbulent flow at low Reynolds number  
Author(s): Birouk, M (Birouk, Madjid); Abou Al-Sood, MM (Abou Al-Sood, Maher M.) 
Source: NUMERICAL HEAT TRANSFER PART A-APPLICATIONS  Volume: 51  Issue: 1  Pages: 39-57  DOI: 10.1080/10407780600710227  Published: JAN 1 2007   
Abstract: The drag coefficient of a sphere immersed in turbulent air flow in the Reynolds number (Re = U(infinity)d/v(infinity)) range up to 250 and turbulence intensity (u(infinity)'/U-infinity) up to 60% is computed numerically. Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS) are solved in Cartesian coordinates by using a blocked-off technique. To our knowledge, the present work is the first to employ the blocked-off technique for flow over a sphere. Closure for the turbulence stress term is accomplished by testing four different turbulence closure models. The main findings of the present investigation are that the laminar numerical data compare well with numerical and experimental published work. However, different turbulence closure models produce different trends in the range of Reynolds number up to Re = 100, and this difference is demarcated by the nonagreement between the turbulent predictions and the "standard" drag coefficient results. However, the results obtained using Menter's SST turbulence model show fair agreement with the well-known sphere "standard" drag over the range of test conditions explored here. Thus, the present results confirm recently published findings, which suggest that the free-stream turbulence intensity does not have a significant effect on the sphere mean drag.

Title: Laser pulse heating of steel surface: Consideration of phase-change process

Abstract: Laser pulse heating and the phase-change process taking place in the region irradiated by a laser beam are considered. A numerical method is employed to predict temperature field and recessing velocities of evaporating and melting surfaces. An experiment is conducted to compare the cavity size obtained from experiment with the prediction. The prediction of the recession velocity of the evaporating surface is compared with the results of a one-dimensional closed-form solution. It is found that the mushy zones at the solid-liquid and liquid-vapor interfaces are visible at some depth below the irradiated surface. The recession velocity of the evaporating front velocity follows almost the temporal variation of the laser heating pulse; moreover, recession velocity of the solid-liquid interface is higher than that corresponding to the liquid-vapor interface. The cavity shape predicted from the present simulation agrees well with experiment. In addition, the prediction of the recession velocity of the evaporating surface agrees well with the closed-form solutions.

Title: Numerical study on the thawing process of biological tissue induced by laser irradiation  
Author(s): Zhou, JH (Zhou, JH); Liu, J (Liu, J); Yu, AB (Yu, AB) 
Source: JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME  Volume: 127  Issue: 3  Pages: 416-431  DOI: 10.1115/1.1894294  Published: JUN 2005   
Abstract: Most of the laser applications in medicine and biology involve thermal effects. The laser-tissue thermal interaction has therefore received more and more attentions in recent years. However previous works were mainly focused on the case of laser heating on normal tissues (37 degrees C or above). To date, little is known on the mechanisms of laser heating on the frozen biological tissues. Several latest experimental investigations have demonstrated that lasers have great potentials in tissue cryopreservation. But the lack of theoretical interpretation limits its further application in this area. The present paper proposes a numerical model for the thawing of biological tissues caused by laser irradiation. The Monte Carlo approach and the effective heat capacity method are, respectively, employed to simulate the light propagation and solid-liquid phase change heat transfer The proposed model has four important features: (1) the tissue is considered as a nonideal material, in which phase transition occurs over a wide temperature range; (2) the solid phase, transition phase, and the liquid phase have different thermophysical properties; (3) the variations in optical properties due to phase-change are also taken into consideration; and (4) the light distribution is changing continually with the advancement of the thawing fronts. To this end, 15 thawing-front geometric configurations are presented for the Monte Carlo simulation. The least-squares parabola fitting technique is applied to approximate the shape of the thawing front. And then, a detailed algorithm of calculating the photon reflection/refraction behaviors at the thawing front is described. Finally, we develop a coupled light/heat transport solution procedure for the laser-induced thawing of frozen tissues. The proposed model is compared with three test problems and good agreement is obtained. The calculated results show that the light reflectance/transmittance at the tissue surface are continually changing with the progression of the thawing fronts and that lasers provide a new heating method superior to conventional heating through surface conduction because it can achieve a uniform volumetric heating. Parametric studies are performed to test the influences of the optical properties of tissue on the thawing process. The proposed model is rather general in nature and therefore can be applied to other nonbiological problems as long as the materials are absorbing and scattering media.

Abstract: In order to provide a quantitative disclosure on the RFA (radiofrequency ablation)induced thermal ablation effects within thyroid tissues, this paper has developed a three-dimensional finite element simulation strategy based on a MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)-reconstructed model. The thermal lesion's growth was predicted and interpreted under two treatment conditions, i.e. single-cooled-electrode modality and two-cooled-electrode system. The results show that the thermal lesion's growth is significantly affected by two factors including the position of RF electrode and thermal-physiological behavior of the breathing airflow. Additional parametric studies revealed several valuable phenomena, e.g. with the electrode's movement, thermal injury with varying severity would happen to the trachea wall. Besides, the changes in airflow mass produced evident effects on the total heat flux of thyroid surface, while the changes in breathing frequency only generated minor effects that can be ignored. The present study provided a better understanding on the thermal lesions of RFA within thyroid domain, which will help guide future treatment of the thyroid cancer. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Abstract: This article is dedicated to present a MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) based three-dimensional finite element modeling on the thermal manifestations relating to the pathophysiology of thyroid gland. An efficient approach for identifying the metabolic dysfunctions of thyroid has also been demonstrated through tracking the localized non-uniform thermal distribution or enhanced dynamic imaging. The temperature features over the skin surface and thyroid domain have been characterized using the numerical simulation and experimental measurement which will help better interpret the thermal physiological mechanisms of the thyroid under steady-state or water-cooling condition. Further, parametric simulations on the hypermetabolism symptoms of hyperthyroidism and thermal effects within thyroid domain caused by varying breathing airflow in the trachea and blood-flow in artery and vein were performed. It was disclosed that among all the parameters, the airflow volume has the largest effect on the total heat flux of thyroid surface. However, thermal contributions caused by varying the breathing frequency and blood-flow velocity are negligibly small. The present study suggests a generalized way for simulating the close to reality physiological behavior or process of human thyroid, which is of significance for disease diagnosis and treatment planning.

Abstract: A three-dimensional (3D) simulation of bioheat transfer is crucial to analyze the physiological processes and evaluate many therapeutic/diagnostic practices spanning from high to low temperature medicine. In this paper we develop an efficient numerical scheme for solving 3D transient bioheat transfer equations based on the alternating direction implicit finite-difference method (ADI-FDM). An algorithm is proposed to deal with the boundary condition for irregular domain which could capture accurately the complex boundary and reduce considerably the staircase effects. Furthermore, the local adaptive mesh technology is introduced to improve the computational accuracy for irregular boundary and the domains with large temperature gradient. The detailed modification to ADI-FDM is given to accommodate such special grid structure, in particular. Combination of adaptive-mesh technology and ADI-FDM could significantly improve the computational accuracy and decrease the computational cost. Extensive results of numerical experiments demonstrate that the algorithm developed in the current work is very effective to predict the temperature distribution during hyperthermia and cryosurgery. This work may play an important role in developing a computational planning tool for hyperthermia and cryosurgery in the near future.

Title: Evaluation on the Power-Generation Capacity of an Implantable Thermoelectric Generator Driven by Radioisotope Fuel  
Author(s): Yang, Y (Yang, Yang); Liu, J (Liu, Jing) 
Source: JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME  Volume: 135  Issue: 7  Article Number: 071004  DOI: 10.1115/1.4024065  Published: JUL 2013   
Abstract: Embedding a thermoelectric generator (TEG) in a biological body is a promising way to supply electronic power in the long term for an implantable medical device (IMD). The unique merit of such a method lies in its direct utilization of the temperature difference intrinsically existing throughout the whole biological body. Therefore, it can resolve the service life mismatch between the IMD and its battery. In order to promote the stability of the power-generation capacity of the implanted TEG, this paper is dedicated to study a low cost and highly safe practical pattern of implanting a TEG driven by the radioisotope fuel into a human body. Recurring to the thermal energy releasing during disintegration of the radioactive isotope, it can guarantee a marked promotion in the temperature difference across the implanted TEG, consequently supplying enough power for the IMDs. A bioheat transfer model with or without a large vessel is established to characterize the feasibility and working performance of the method. The numerical simulation and parametric studies on tissue status, device properties, and environmental conditions revealed that, no matter in what conditions, the implanted TEG driven by the radioisotope fuel can always offer a much higher energy output than that provided by body heat alone. Meanwhile, in vivo/surrounding environment, isotope conditions, and intentional skin surface cooling also exhibit a direct influence on the temperature distribution of the implantable TEG and thus affect the working performance. Coordinating with the intentionally imposed cooling on the skin surface, the maximum TEG power can reach several mW, which is strong enough to meet the power consumption of the IMDs. These results were expected to be a valuable reference for designing an implantable TEG, which may actually be used in future clinics.

Abstract: A spectral element method is developed for the numerical solution of the Pennes bioheat transfer equation which models the thermal behavior of the living tissue. For the one and two dimensional cases, the implementation of this method is completely explained. In the two dimensional case, both triangular and quadrilateral elements are investigated. Through test problems, the discretization error generated from this method is reported. In the triangular elements, the error is obtained when quadrature points coincide and do not coincide with nodal points.

Abstract: Objective To establish the feasibility of infrared thermal imaging as a reproducible, noninvasive method for assessing changes in skin temperature within the supraclavicular region in vivo. 
Study design Thermal imaging was used to assess the effect of a standard cool challenge (by placement of the participant's feet or hand in water at 20 degrees C) on the temperature of the supraclavicular region in healthy volunteer participants of normal body mass index in 3 age groups, 3-8, 13-18, and 35-58 years of age. 
Results We demonstrated a highly localized increase in temperature within the supraclavicular region together with a significant age-related decline under both baseline and stimulated conditions. 
Conclusion Thermogenesis within the supraclavicular region can be readily quantified by thermal imaging. This noninvasive imaging technique now has the potential to be used to assess brown adipose tissue function alone, or in combination with other techniques, in order to determine the roles of thermogenesis in energy balance and, therefore, obesity prevention.

Title: Theoretical model for thermal protection by microencapsulated phase change micro/nanoparticles during hyperthermia

Source: HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER  Volume: 48  Issue: 4  Pages: 573-584  DOI: 10.1007/s00231-011-0907-4  Published: APR 2012   
Abstract: In this study, a new method for thermal protection by microcapsulated phase change micro/nanoparticles during hyperthermia was proposed and a three-dimensional theoretical model was developed to test the feasibility of this method. Effective capacity method was used to get the transient temperature distribution in cancerous tissue embedded with superparamagnetic nanoparticles and healthy tissue embedded with phase change materials (PCMs). The results indicated that embedding micro/nano PCMs can decrease the healthy tissue temperature and has no obvious influence on the temperature in cancerous tissue under the same heating condition, which can help protect the healthy tissue during hyperthermia. The influences of the domain, concentration, latent heat, and the lower and upper phase transition temperatures of the PCM on the thermal protection efficacy were also further analyzed in detail. This study may open a new technical approach for enlarging application of hyperthermia.

Abstract: With the dramatic advances in IR imaging technology the IR imaging technique has the potential to become a promising non-contact in-vivo diagnostic tool for the early detection of melanoma [1] as well as other conditions in which the temperature of the body deviates from normal temperature. Active or dynamic IR (thermal) imaging, which involves introducing external cooling, can induce or enhance relevant thermal contrast observed on the skin surface, leading to temperature differences that can be accurately measured with a properly designed IR imaging system. When the skin surface is cooled down in active IR imaging, the variation in the thermal properties of the lesion located underneath the surface result in identifiable temperature differences from the surrounding healthy tissue in the recovery phase, and therefore the dynamic thermal response of the structure acquired using active imaging provides critical information to distinguish the diseased and healthy tissues. Regarding the effectiveness of the active IR imaging, in this study, the performance of varied cooling parameters, including cooling method, cooling temperature, cooling duration, and cooling depth are discussed. Toward the objective of minimizing the discomfort of patient, by evaluating the transient temperature difference in the recovery phase for varied cooling conditions, our goal is to find out the optimized cooling conditions, which can provide effective thermal response contrast in the recovery phase, while applying appropriate cooling temperature and duration to facilitate the clinical feasibility of this technique. The optimized cooling condition concluded from the simulation will be verified by the in-vivo dynamic thermal imaging experiments.

Abstract: The unique merit of the implantable thermoelectric generator lies in its direct utilization of the temperature difference intrinsically existing throughout the whole biological body. Therefore, it can resolve the service life mismatch between the IMD and its battery. In order to promoting the TEG maximum power, a piece of radioisotope fuel was fixed on the TEG. hot junction. Recurring to the thermal energy released during disintegration of radioactive isotope, it can guarantee a marked promotion in the temperature difference across the implanted TEG; consequently apply enough power for the IMDs.

Title: Analytical solution of the parabolic and hyperbolic heat transfer equations with constant and transient heat flux conditions on skin tissue

Abstract: In this article, the parabolic (Pennes bioheat equation) and hyperbolic (thermal wave) bioheat transfer models for constant, periodic and pulse train heat flux boundary conditions are solved analytically by applying the Laplace transform method for skin as a semi-infinite and finite domain. The bioheat transfer analysis with transient heat flux on skin tissue has only been studied by Pennes equation for a semi-infinite domain. For modeling heat transfer in short duration of an initial transient, or when the propagation speed of the thermal wave is finite, there are major differences between the results of parabolic and hyperbolic heat transfer equations. The non-Fourier bioheat transfer equation describes the thermal behavior in the biological tissues better than Fourier equation. The outcome of transient heat flux condition shows that by penetrating into the depths beneath the skin subjected to heat, the amplitude of temperature response decreases significantly. The blood perfusion rate can be predicted using the phase shift between the surface temperature and transient surface heat flux. The thermal damage of the skin is studied by applying both the parabolic and hyperbolic bioheat transfer equations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: This work applies a three-dimensional lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), to solve the Pennes bio-heat equation (BHE), in order to predict the temperature distribution in a spherical tissue, with blood perfusion, metabolism and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) heat sources, during magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH). So, heat dissipation of MNPs under an alternating magnetic field has been studied and effect of different factors such as induction and frequency of magnetic field and volume fraction of MNPs has been investigated. Then, effect of MNPs dispersion on temperature distribution inside tumor and its surrounding healthy tissue has been shown. Also, effect of blood perfusion, thermal conductivity of tumor, frequency and amplitude of magnetic field on temperature distribution has been explained. Results show that the LBM has a good accuracy to solve the bio-heat transfer problems.

Abstract: In non-invasive thermal diagnostics, accurate correlations between the thermal image at skin surface and interior human physiology are desired. In this work, an estimation methodology to determine unknown geometrical parameters of an embedded tumor is proposed. We define a functional that represents the mismatch between a measured experimental temperature profile, which may be obtained by infrared thermography on the skin surface, and the solution of an appropriate boundary problem. This functional is related to the geometrical parameters through the solution of the boundary problem, in such a way that finding the minimum of this functional form also means finding the unknown geometrical parameters of the embedded tumor. Sensitivity analysis techniques coupled with the adjoint method were considered to compute the shape derivative of the functional. Then, a nonmonotone spectral projected gradient method was implemented to solve the optimization problem of finding the optimal geometric parameters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Although considerable progresses have been made in cryosurgery to treat tumor, thermal injury to collateral structures is still a known complication of cryosurgery. In this study, a new method was proposed to prevent the healthy tissue around the cancerous tissue from thermal injury by microencapsulated phase change micro/nanoparticles, in which the phase change materials (PCMs) with large latent heat and low thermal conductivity are microencapsulated by liposome and delivered to the healthy tissue by mainline, arterial injection, hypodermic injection or direct injection. The three-dimensional transient temperature field in human body containing one tumor and embedded PCMs in the surrounding healthy tissue was numerically studied. The effects of the PCMs concentration, the phase change temperature, the temperature range near the phase change point, the latent heat and the PCMs distribution (especially the number of sides that PCMs cover, and the distance between the PCMs domain and the cancerous domain) were further discussed. The computational analysis showed that embedding PCMs in the healthy tissue around the cancerous tissue can significantly reduce the cryoinjury to the surrounding healthy tissue. The result also suggested that not embedding the PCMs directly adjacent to the cancerous tissue will help to improve the protection efficacy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Macroscale thermal models for biological tissues can be developed either by the mixture theory of continuum mechanics or by the porous-media theory. Characterized by its simplicity, the former applies scaling-down from the global scale. The latter uses scaling-up from the microscale by the volume averaging, thus offers the connection between microscale and macroscale properties and is capable of describing the rich blood-tissue interaction in biological tissues. By using the porous-media approach, a general bioheat transport model is developed with the required closure provided. Both blood and tissue macroscale temperature fields are shown to satisfy the dual-phase-lagging (DPL) energy equations. Thermal waves and possible resonance may appear due to the coupled conduction between blood and tissue. For the DPL bioheat transport, contributions of the initial temperature distribution, the source term and the initial rate of change of temperature are shown to be inter-expressible under linear boundary conditions. This reveals the solution structure and considerably simplifies the development of solutions of the DPL bioheat equations. Effectiveness and features of the developed solution structure theorems are demonstrated via examining bioheat transport in skin tissue and during magnetic hyperthermia.

The analytical and numerical finite difference solutions reveal the accuracy of the model.

Abstract: Inappropriate heat and mass transfer is an extremely important factor to cause rheumatics of human knee which however receives few attentions up to now. Understanding the thermal behaviors of pathological knee tissues can help diagnose its pathological status and find out the most efficient therapeutical way, which is hard to access otherwise. This paper is dedicated to develop a theoretical model for characterizing the three-dimensional temperature fields of human knee by taking its real anatomical structure into consideration. Based on the classical Pennes bioheat transfer equation, the temperature fields of normal knees and pathological ones under various thermal conditions were numerically simulated and compared, which would help better understand the disease mechanisms causing trouble for human knee. Meanwhile, a medical infrared image system was adopted to map the surface temperature of human knee which qualitatively verifies the theoretical prediction and its diagnostic value. Further, effects of heating from outside on the knee tissue and interventional hyperthermia based on vessel heating were also evaluated. Potential therapeutical strategies were suggested for the thermal rehabilitation of rheumatic knee in the near future. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In non-invasive thermal diagnostics, accurate correlations between the thermal image on skin surface and interior human physiology are often desired, which require general solutions for the bioheat equation. In this study an estimation methodology is presented to determine unknown thermophysical or geometrical parameters of a tumor region using the temperature profile on the skin surface that may be obtained by infrared thermography. To solve these inverse problems a second order finite difference scheme was implemented to solve the bioheat Pennes equation with mixed boundary conditions in two and three dimensions. Then, the Pattern Search algorithm was used to estimate the different parameters by minimizing a fitness function involving the temperature profiles obtained from simulated or clinical data to those obtained by the finite different scheme.

Title: The effect of magnetic nanoparticle dispersion on temperature distribution in a spherical tissue in magnetic fluid hyperthermia using the lattice Boltzmann method  
Author(s): Golneshan, AA (Golneshan, A. A.); Lahonian, M (Lahonian, M.) 
Source: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYPERTHERMIA  Volume: 27  Issue: 3  Pages: 266-274  DOI: 10.3109/02656736.2010.519370  Published: 2011   
Abstract: In clinical applications of magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) for cancer treatment it is very important to ensure maximum damage to the tumour while protecting the normal tissue. The resultant heating pattern by magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in the tumour is closely related to the dispersion of MNPs. In this study the effect of MNPs dispersion on temperature distribution in a tumour and surrounding healthy tissue, during MFH, has been investigated. Accordingly, the Pennes bio-heat equation (BHE) in a spherical tissue with Neumann curved boundary condition has been resolved. The effects of blood perfusion, metabolism heat generation as well as MNPs heat dissipation in an alternating magnetic field as source term, have been considered. To solve the Pennes BHE, the three dimensional lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) has been used. To show the accuracy of the model, simulations have been compared with analytical, experimental and numerical results, reported in the literature. Then, temperature distribution within tissue has been investigated in two cases, homogeneous distribution and Gaussian distribution of specific absorption rate (SAR). Results showed that for the studied cases, unlike homogeneous distribution, Gaussian distribution of SAR is able to raise the temperature of tumour cells above the treatment temperature.

Title: A heat transfer model of skin tissue for the detection of lesions: sensitivity analysis

Abstract: In this paper, we study the transient thermal response of skin layers to determine to which extent the surface temperature distribution reflects the properties of subsurface structures, such as benign or malignant lesions. Specifically, we conduct a detailed sensitivity analysis to interpret the changes in the surface temperature distribution as a function of variations in thermophysical properties, blood perfusion rate, metabolic heat generation and thicknesses of skin layers, using a multilayer computational model. These properties can vary from individual to individual or depend on location, external and internal influences, and in certain situations accurate property data are not available in the literature. Therefore, the uncertainties in these data could potentially affect the accuracy of the interpretation/diagnosis of a lesion in a clinical setting. In this study, relevant parameters were varied within characteristic physiological ranges, and differences in the surface temperature response were quantified. It was observed that variations in these parameters have a small influence on the surface temperature distribution. Analysis using this multilayer model was further conducted to determine the sensitivity of transient thermal response to different lesion sizes. This work validates the idea of examining the transient thermal response obtained using a thermal imaging system with the objective of lesion identification. The modeling effort and the sensitivity analysis reported in this paper comprise a portion of a comprehensive research effort involving experimentation on a skin phantom model as well as measurements on patients in a clinical setting, that are currently underway. One of the preliminary results from the ongoing clinical trial is also included to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Thermal imaging is used extensively in the detection of infrared spectrum. This principle has found great and effective use in the screening of potential SARS patients. This paper investigates the application of several novel brain-inspired softcomputing techniques in the study of the correlation of superficial thermal images against the true internal body temperature. Given some backgrounds that the existing infrared systems used at various boarder checkpoints have high false-negative rate, the novel fuzzy neural networks (FNNs) employed in the back-end of the system have a role as a thermal analysis tool with high degree of accuracy. To achieve the automation and improve the accuracy in the feature extraction process of the infrared images, some forms of image processing technique based on the novel FNNs are also proposed in this paper. Extensive experimentations are undertaken to examine such intelligent medical decision support tool. Benchmarking was carried out on the novel FNN architectures which include pseudo outer-product fuzzy neural network (POPFNN), evolving fuzzy neural network (EFuNN), fuzzy adaptive learning control network (Falcon), generic self-organizing fuzzy neural network (GenSoFNN), and fuzzy cerebellar model articulation controller (FCMAC), and their results are promising. The performance of the GenSoFNN network is the most appealing among others. In addition, the experiments are conducted on real-life data taken from the Emergency Department (AM), Tan Tock Seng Hospital (the designated SARS center in Singapore) to confirm the validity of such design in the real time.

Abstract: A meshless model based on radial basis function and method of fundamental solution (RBF-MFS) is developed to investigate bioheat transfer problems. First. A time-stepping theta-method is used in handling the time variable in the Pennes bioheat equation. Then, the particular solution is approximated by a linear combination of radial basis functions, and the homogeneous solution is approximately determined by the method of fundamental solution. The multi-subdomain RBF-MFS technique is implemented for analysing problems containing different materials and/or multi-connected regions. The efficiency of the proposed method is assessed by several examples including normal tissue, tissue with tumor and burned tissue. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Thermal conductivities of biological tissue protein including normal protein and denatured protein were determined over the temperature range 0 degrees C and 37 degrees C using the tiny thermal probe method. The tiny thermal probe system had the advantages of high accuracy, a short test time, a low temperature rise and little water removal. The results showed that the thermal conductivities of the samples were found to increase with temperature both in the normal protein state and in the denatured protein state. The average value of thermal conductivities of normal proteins and denatured proteins were 0.503 W.m(-1)K(-1) and 0.533 W.m(-1)K(-1), respectively. The thermal conductivities of denatured proteins were higher than that of normal proteins. The tiny thermal probe method of thermal conductivity measurement was found to give accurate and consistent results.

Abstract: We have recently developed a thermal (infrared - IR) imaging system that allows accurate measurements of transient temperature distributions of the skin surface. It relies on active infrared imaging for the characterization of skin lesions. We hypothesize that lesions with increased proliferative potential or inflammatory processes in the skin generate quantifiable amounts of heat and possess an ability to reheat more quickly than the surrounding normal skin. We demonstrate that the visualization and measurement of the transient thermal response of the skin to a cooling excitation can aid the identification of skin lesions of different origin. In the preliminary studies we focused on optimizing this high-resolution infrared scanning system in order to evaluate thermal images of the skin with the aim to distinguish benign from malignant pigmented lesions. Such an imaging tool is expected to improve the diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity for melanoma as well as other skin cancers, while decreasing the number of unnecessary biopsies. Therefore, we are currently conducting a pilot clinical trial of our transient thermal imaging system to verify the feasibility of the described approach in distinguishing pigmented lesions of varying malignant potential. In our trial patients who possess a pigmented lesion with a clinical indication for biopsy are selected to participate in the study. After scanning the lesions, they are biopsied and graded for malignant potential. Biopsy results are correlated with thermal images and bright light images in order to evaluate thermal associations with malignant potential.

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study is to assess the potential of dynamic infrared imaging (DIRI) as a functional, noninvasive technique for evaluating the skin acute toxicity and tumor control within the framework of the Argentine boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) program for cutaneous malignant melanoma. 
Methods: Two patients enrolled in the Argentine phase I/II BNCT clinical trial for cutaneous malignant melanoma were studied with DIRI. An uncooled infrared camera, providing a video output signal, was employed to register the temperature evolution of the normal skin and tumor regions in patients subjected to a mild local cooling (cold stimulus). In order to study the spatial correlation between dose and acute skin reactions, three-dimensional representations of the superficial dose delivered to skin were constructed and cameralike projections of the dose distribution were coregistered with visible and infrared images. 
Results: The main erythematous reaction was observed clinically between the second and fifth week post-BNCT. Concurrently, with its clinical onset, a reactive increase above the basal skin temperature was observed with DIRI in the third week post-BNCT within regions that received therapeutic doses. Melanoma nodules appeared as highly localized hyperthermic regions. 2 min after stimulus, these regions reached a temperature plateau and increased in size. Temperature differences with respect to normal skin up to 10 S C were observed in the larger nodules. 
Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest that DIRI, enhanced by the application of cold stimuli, may provide useful functional information associated with the metabolism and vasculature of tumors and inflammatory processes related to radiation-induced changes in the skin as well. These capabilities are aimed at complementing the clinical observations and standard imaging techniques, such as CT and Doppler ultrasound. (C) 2009 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Abstract: Advances in laser, microwave, and similar technologies have led to recent developments of thermal treatments for disease and injury involving skin tissue. In spite of the widespread use of heating therapies in dermatology, they do not draw upon the detailed understanding of the biothermomechanics of behavior, for none exists to date, even though each behavioral facet is well established and understood. It is proposed that a detailed understanding of the coupled biological-mechanical response under thermal agitation will contribute to the design, characterization, and optimization of strategies for delivering better treatment. For a comprehensive understanding on the underlying mechanisms of thermomechanical behavior of skin tissue, recent progress on bioheat transfer, thermal damage, thermomechanics, and thermal pain should be systematically reviewed. This article focuses on the transfer of heat through skin tissue. Experimental study, theoretical analysis, and numerical modeling of skin thermal behavior are reviewed, with theoretical analysis carried out and closed-form solutions obtained for simple one-layer Fourier theory based model. Non-Fourier bioheat transfer models for skin tissue are discussed, and various skin cooling technologies summarized. Finally, the predictive capacity of various heat transfer models is demonstrated with selected case studies.

Title: Suitability of using far-infrared imaging system for noncontact evaluation on working state of implantable medical devices  
Author(s): Yang, Y (Yang, Yang); Wei, XJ (Wei, Xiao-Juan); Liu, J (Liu, Jing) 
Source: JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS  Volume: 105  Issue: 6  Article Number: 064701  DOI: 10.1063/1.3093868  Published: MAR 15 2009   
Abstract: The far-infrared thermal imaging is a promising noncontact way to assess the working state of an implantable medical device (IMD). The unique merit of this method lies in its direct detection of the unusual skin surface temperature distribution caused by the implanted IMD. This paper is dedicated to present a comprehensive investigation on the suitability of using far-infrared system to evaluate the thermal state at the skin surface above the implantation location of the IMD under various working, physiological, or environmental thermal conditions. It was found that an evident variation in temperature as disclosed on the skin surface is beneficial for the far-infrared thermal imaging detection. In addition, numerical simulations were also performed on three dimensional bioheat transfer problems in human bodies embedded with IMD by different implantation depth and physical characteristics. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation indicated that for a specific image system with fixed temperature resolution, when the IMD is embedded as close as possible to the superficial skin, the abnormal region of temperature on skin surface can be much more visible. Conceptual experiments either in vitro or in vivo are implemented to preliminarily demonstrate the theoretical predictions. To further improve the detection of an implanted IMD, intentional cooling by the alcohol was proposed and evaluated. Given the fact that several information of an implanted IMD can be revealed through the infrared thermograph, such noncontact imaging method could serve well as an assessment approach without causing any wound and radiation to human body.

Abstract: To study the radiation emitted by the human skin, the emissivity of its surface must be known. We present a new approach to measure the emissivity of the human skin in vivo. Our method is based on the calculation of the difference of two infrared images: one acquired before projecting a CO(2) laser beam on the surface of the skin and the other after such projection. The difference image contains the radiation reflected by the skin, which is used to calculate the emissivity, making use of Kirchhoff's law and the Helmholtz reciprocity relation. With our method, noncontact measurements are achieved, and the determination of the skin temperature is not needed, which has been an inconvenience for other methods. We show that it is possible to make determinations of the emissivity at specific wavelengths. Last, our results confirm that the human skin obeys Lambert's law of diffuse reflection and that it behaves almost like a blackbody at a wavelength of 10.6 mu m.

Abstract: Based on the geometrical characteristics of the female breast tissue, a bioheat transfer model is setup to study the surface temperature expression of the breast with a malignant tumor. Resort to the finite element analysis, effects of geometrical parameters of the tumor (the location and the size) and thermal diagnosis conditions (the environmental temperature and the convective heat transfer coefficient) on the surface temperature expression are investigated. Numerical results show that it is difficult to identify the tumor through surface temperature expression, if the tumor is more than 3cm below the surface. The effect of the environmental temperature on the surface temperature expression is significant, but that of the surface convective heat transfer is not significant.

Title: TRANSIENT THERMAL RESPONSE OF SKIN TISSUE

Source: HT2008: PROCEEDING OF THE ASME SUMMER HEAT TRANSFER CONFERENCE, VOL 3  Pages: 355-361  Published: 2009   
Abstract: The increased availability of thermal imaging cameras has led to a growing interest in the application of infrared imaging techniques to the detection and identification of subsurface structures. These imaging techniques are based on the following principle: when a surface is heated or cooled, variations in the thermal properties of a structure located underneath the surface result in identifiable temperature contours on it. These contours are characteristic of the structure's shape, depth, and its thermal properties. We study the use of the transient thermal response of skin layers to determine to which extent the surface temperature distribution reflects the properties of subsurface structures, such as lesions. A numerical model using the finite element method is described to obtain this response and key results are reported in the paper. A sensitivity study is conducted first to better understand the thermal response of the system and the role of various system and model parameters. We explore the extent to which we are able to draw conclusions regarding the size, depth and nature of subsurface structures and accuracy of these conclusions based on the surface temperature response alone. This work validates the idea of examining the transient thermal response and using thermal imaging as a solution for lesion identification. A sensitivity study of surface temperature distribution to variations of thermophysical properties, blood perfusion rate, and thicknesses of skin layers is performed. It is observed that variations in these parameters have little impact on the surface temperature distribution. The work reported in the paper is a portion of a comprehensive research effort involving experiments on a phantom model as well as measurements on patients. Future work will focus on comparing the results of our 2D numerical modeling efforts with the experimental results using a skin tissue-mimicking phantom. Knowledge gained from the modeling and experimental efforts will be utilized in characterizing lesions in patient studies. The focus of this paper is the computational sensitivity analysis.

Title: SKIN IMAGING WITH INFRARED THERMOGRAPHY AND CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY

Abstract: The implementation of in vivo imaging technologies, such as digital photography, dermoscopy and confocal scanning laser reflectance microscopy (CSLM) in dermatology has led to recent improvements in recognizing skin lesions. Specifically, in the case of skin cancer, a key issue is that the rate of cancerous tissue growth and changes in its spatial extent with time are linked to the energy released locally by these uncontrolled metabolic processes. We believe that with a properly designed infrared (IR) imaging and measurement system combined with thermal analysis, one can characterize healthy and diseased tissue. 
This paper augments our previous work, in which we introduced a computational model to estimate the location and size of lesions using IR imaging data. In this paper, we focus on calibrating the IR camera and correcting its inherent artifacts. Calibration and corrections are first performed on a blackbody object and then on human skin images in order to acquire accurate surface temperature distributions. As future work, in addition to these correction steps, several other steps, such as accounting for emissivity variations will be developed for clinical studies. 
In addition to IR imaging, images acquired by in vivo confocal scanning laser microscopy are used to examine the structure of the human skin for different skin types. Our aim is to generate additional data necessary for the IR imaging model by further analyzing the 3D structure of healthy tissue and the lesion. Specifically, in clinical studies, confocal images will be used to describe thermal associations with skin lesion and its blood supply in order to refine our transient thermal model of skin tissue.

Title: A coupled dual reciprocity BEM/genetic algorithm for identification of blood perfusion parameters  
Author(s): Partridge, PW (Partridge, Paul W.); Wrobel, LC (Wrobel, Luiz C.) 
Source: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NUMERICAL METHODS FOR HEAT & FLUID FLOW  Volume: 19  Issue: 1  Pages: 25-38  DOI: 10.1108/09615530910922134  Published: 2009   
Abstract: Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present an inverse analysis procedure based on a coupled numerical formulation through which the coefficients describing non-linear thermal properties of blood perfusion may be identified. 
Design/methodology/approach - The coupled numerical technique involves a combination of the dual reciprocity boundary element method (DRBEM) and a genetic algorithm (GA) for the solution of the Pennes bioheat equation. Both linear and quadratic temperature-dependent variations are considered for the blood perfusion. 
Findings - The proposed DRBEM formulation requires no internal discretisation and, in this case, no internal nodes either, apart from those defining the interface tissue/tumour. It is seen that the skin temperature variation changes as the blood perfusion increases, and in certain cases flat or nearly flat curves are produced. The proposed algorithm has difficulty to identify the perfusion parameters in these cases, although a more advanced genetic algorithm may provide improved results. 
Practical implications - The coupled technique allows accurate inverse solutions of the Pennes bioheat equation for quantitative diagnostics on the physiological conditions of biological bodies and for optimisation of hyperthermia for cancer therapy. 
Originality/value - The proposed technique can be used to guide hyperthermia cancer treatment, which normally involves heating tissue to 42-43 degrees C. When heated up to this range of temperatures, the blood flow in normal tissues, e.g. skin and muscle, increases significantly, while blood flow in the tumour zone decreases. Therefore, the consideration of temperature-dependent blood perfusion in this case is not only essential for the correct modelling of the problem, but also should provide larger skin temperature variations, making the identification problem easier.

Abstract: The three-dimensional (3-D) thermal diagnosis has become a potential assistant medical diagnosis method. But the reconstruction of 3-D heat source is very complicated and difficult. just from the surface temperature data, the 3-D distribution of heat and temperature for organisms can be reconstructed by solving Pennes' bio-heat equation with the Monte Carlo method in this paper. In detail, the inverse problem of bio-heat conduction can be solved with the Markov chain Monte Carlo method based on hierarchical Bayesian models, and the 3-D distribution of heat and temperature can be reconstructed through the Monte Carlo method of fixed random walk.

Title: Focal plane array based infrared thermography in fine physical experiment

Abstract: By two examples of dissimilar physical phenomena causing thermophysical effects, the unique capabilities of one of the up-to-date methods of experimental physics-focal plane array (FPA) based infrared (IR) thermography (IRT), are demonstrated distinctly. Experimenters inexperienced in IRT can grasp how this method provides a means for combining real-time visualization with quantitative analysis. A narrow-band short-wavelength IR camera was used in the experiments. It is discussed and stated that IRT is best matched and suited to the next two test conditions-when a heated specimen is thin and when heat is generated in the immediate region of a surface of a solid. The first prerequisite is realized in the search for directional patterns of combined low-power radiation sources with the use of the IRT-aided method. The second one is realized in studies of water vapour adsorption on uneven (irregular) surfaces of solid materials. With multiple swatches taken from a set of different fabrics and used as experimental samples, a sharp distinction between adsorptivities of their surfaces is strikingly illustrated by IRT time-domain measurements exhibiting the associated thermal effect ranging within an order of magnitude. It is justified that the described IRT-aided test can find practical implementation at least in the light industry. Emissivities of different fabrics are evaluated experimentally with the described reflection method based on the narrow spectral range of IRT. On the basis of direct IR observations, attention is paid to the need for close control over the surface temperature increase while the adsorption isotherms are being measured. Sensitivity of the FPA-based IRT method, as applied to examine the kinetics of initial stages of adsorption of gaseous molecules on the solid surface, is evaluated analytically and quantitatively. The relationship between the amount of adsorbate and the measurable excess of adsorbent temperature is found. It is discovered that the method makes it possible to control nano-quantities of the adsorbed matter, namely, it is sensitive to an incipient molecular film of 1/300-monolayer effective thickness.

Abstract: The early detection of disease especially tumor in its infant stage is extremely important for saving patient life and reducing medical cost. As is well known, an abnormal temperature on skin surface generally implies certain disease state. However, this method is still subjected to certain limitations such as low accuracy and sensitivity. Here, noticing that the human body is sweating all the time which has strong relationship with human health status, we proposed to adopt the sweating state as an effective index for disease diagnostics based on thermal infrared image mapping. Through theoretical evaluation and experimental measurement, it was discovered that, the quantity of sweating from human skin surface due to being covered by a thin film provides a significant signal for health evaluation and affects significantly the real temperature of skin surface. Through intentionally controlling the sweating, the disease can be more easily diagnosed via a far-infrared image equipment. Comparative evaluation on normal or tumor skins indicate that, if controlling sweating by covering skin with a thin film to prevent release of sweat, the temperature rise will differ a lot between these two cases, say about 2.43 degrees C vs. 4.21 degrees C. Therefore, taking account of the quantity of sweating and the final surface temperature abnormality, a better diagnostics on human disease can be expected. This offers a new auxiliary diagnostic modality and extends the working capacity of a conventional infrared thermometer.

Abstract: Recent advances in wearable sensors, as well as wireless technology and mobile computing have fostered a dramatic growth of a new generation of monitoring systems that allow one to record physiological data from individuals carrying on daily activities in the home and outdoor environments. For many applications of wearable systems, there is typically a need for achieving stable contact of the sensing elements with the skin, which requires that sensors be embedded in a fixing material (which can be an elastic bandage or a tightly-fit undergarment). However, when performing temperature monitoring in this way, measurement error may be resulted from the change of heat transfer of the local skin area by the fixing material. This study aims to disclose the effect of the fixing material on temperature measurement via skin-contact wearable sensors. The results of this study are expected to be valuable for designing wearable devices of temperature measurement.

Abstract: Increased availability of thermal imaging cameras has led to an interest in the application of infrared imaging techniques to the detection and identification of subsurface structures. We study the use of the transient thermal response of skin layers to determine to which extent surface temperature distribution reflects the properties of subsurface structures, such as lesions. A numerical model using the finite element method is described to obtain this response, which enables us to draw conclusions regarding the size, depth and nature of subsurface structures. This work validates the idea of examining the transient thermal response and using thermal imaging as a solution for lesion identification. A sensitivity study of surface temperature distribution to variations of thermophysical properties, blood perfusion rate, and thicknesses of skin layers is performed. It is observed that variations in these parameters have minimal effects on surface temperature distribution.

Three well-known methods for selecting regularization parameter were tested, and two experiments were implemented The first experiment was carried out on a cubic polypropylene whose six faces were free to air, and the second experiment on a cubic polypropylene whose temperature of one face was constant. The inner heat sources and temperature field of the polypropylene in these two experiments were successfully reconstructed.

Title: Analytical analysis of the Pennes bioheat transfer equation with sinusoidal heat flux condition on skin surface

Abstract: This study focuses on the effect of the temperature response of a semi-infinite biological tissue due to a sinusoidal heat flux at the skin. The Pennes bioheat transfer equation such as rho(t)c(t)(partial derivative T/partial derivative t) + W(b)c(b)(T-T-a) = k partial derivative T-2/partial derivative x(2) with the oscillatory heat flux boundary condition such as q(0,t)=q(0)e(iwt) was investigated. By using the Laplace transform, the analytical solution of the Pennes bioheat transfer equation with surface sinusoidal heating condition is found. This analytical expression is suitable for describing the transient temperature response of tissue for the whole time domain from the starting periodic oscillation to the final steady periodic oscillation. The results show that the temperature oscillation due to the sinusoidal heating on the skin surface is unstable in the initial period. Further, it is unavailable to predict the blood perfusion rate via the phase shifting between the surface heat flux and the surface temperature. Moreover, the lower frequency of sinusoidal heat flux on the skin surface induces a more sensitive phase shift response to the blood perfusion rate change, but extends the beginning time of sampling because of the avoidance of the unavailable first cyclic oscillation.

Abstract: In this paper, the dual reciprocity method (DRM) is coupled to a genetic algorithm (GA) in an inverse procedure through which the size and location of a skin tumour may be obtained from temperature measurements at the skin surface. The GA is an evolutionary process which does not require the calculation of sensitivities, search directions or the definition of initial guesses. The DRM in this case requires no internal nodes. It is also shown that the DRM approximation function used is not an important factor for the problem considered here. Results are presented for tumours of different sizes and positions in relation to the skin surface. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title: Suitability of a thermoelectric power generator for implantable medical electronic devices  
Author(s): Yang, Y (Yang, Yang); Wei, XJ (Wei, Xiao-Juan); Liu, J (Liu, Jing) 
Source: JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS  Volume: 40  Issue: 18  Pages: 5790-5800  DOI: 10.1088/0022-3727/40/18/042  Published: SEP 21 2007   
Abstract: Embedding a thermoelectric generator ( TEG) in a biological body is a promising way to supply electronic power in the long term for an implantable medical device ( IMD). The unique merit of this method lies in its direct utilization of the temperature difference intrinsically existing throughout the whole biological body. However, little is known about the practicability of such a power generation strategy up to now. This paper attempts to evaluate the energy generation capacity of an implanted TEG subject to various physiological or environmental thermal conditions. Through theoretical analysis, it was found that the highest temperature gradient occurs near the skin surface of the human body, which suggested a candidate site for implanting and positioning the TEG. In addition, numerical simulations were performed on three- dimensional bioheat transfer problems in human bodies embedded with TEGs at different implantation depths and configurations. To further enhance energy generation of an implanted TEG, several external technical approaches by intentionally cooling or heating the skin surface were proposed and evaluated. Conceptual experiments either in vitro or in vivo were implemented to preliminarily test the theoretical predictions. Given the fact that an IMD generally require very little working energy, the TEG could serve well as a potential long- term energy supplier for such medical practices.

Abstract: This study uses numerical solutions of a bio-heat transfer equation to investigate the relationship between skin surface temperature distributions and internal heat sources under various physiological and environmental conditions. It is found that although a surface temperature distribution depends on all heat source parameters, the properly normalized distribution is primarily affected only by the depth of the heat source. This study provides a physical basis for determining the depth and type of an internal heat source from a thermogram acquired in various environmental conditions and an understanding of the basic relationship between skin surface temperature distributions and internal heat sources.

Abstract: Advancement of the recent micro/nano technology has stimulated the renaissance of using magnetic micro/nano particles embedded in biological tissues for the target tumor hyperthermia. As is well known, mathematical solutions of bioheat transfer involved in hyperthermia treatment are indispensable for computerized optimization of hyperthermia parameters. However, estimating the level of uncertainties associated with tissue temperature and thermal ablation area remains a major challenge. In this article, the uncertainties for the predicted temperatures of tissues due to approximate parameters were studied, based on numerical simulation of three-dimensional (3-D) quasi-steady state electromagnetic (EM field and transient temperature response in biological tissues induced by the external EM field. Contributions of uncertainty from the tissue area permeated with micro/nano particles, the concentration and size of micro/nano particles, and the frequency and strength of the external alternating EM field were analyzed, and the uncertainty limits for temperature distributions in these cases were also estimated. The uncertainty analysis presented in this article is expected to serve as a significant guide for performing a highly efficient and also completely safe tumor hyperthermia using magnetic micro/nano particles.

Abstract: Advancement of the recent micro/nanotechnology stimulates the renaissance of using. magnetic, micro/nanoparticles embedded in tissues for the target tumor hyperthermia. However, there is a strong lack of quantitative understanding of the temperature profiles thus induced by the applied external electromagnetic (EM) field, which may impede the successful operation of this therapy. In the current study, the three-dimensional quasi-steady-state EM field and transient tissue temperature behavior induced by two planar electrodes were numerically investigated. Detailed computations indicated that nanoparticles exhibit an extraordinary highly focused heating on target tumor tissue, which is much stronger than. that in the surrounding areas. This heating effect depends heavily on the properties of the magnetic nanoparticles, which may vary appreciably for,different samples depending on their particle sizes and microstructures. The effect of micro/nanoparticle concentration, heating area, and the frequency and strength of the external alternating EM field were also tested. Moreover, a criterion to determine the appropriate particle concentration thermally important for medical treatment was established. Given accurate thermal and EM parameters for cancerous tissue embedded with nanoparticles, the current model could possibly be applied in the hyperthermia treatment planning and help optimize the surgical procedures.

Abstract: Infrared imaging has frequently been used in clinics to detect changes in skin surface temperature associated with some superficial tumors. In order to accurately detect and diagnose tumors (especially in their early stages) using infrared thermography, enhancement of thermal expression on the skin over the tumor is desired. This study proposed a novel approach to effectively enhance the skin thermal expression of tumor by induced evaporation on skin surface. To illustrate its feasibility, numerical calculation was first applied to simulate the corresponding heat transfer process, from which the three-dimensional transient temperatures of the biological bodies subjected to induced evaporation were theoretically predicted. Further, preliminary infrared imaging experiments on human forearm were also performed, in which water and 75% (V/V) medical ethanol were particularly chosen to be respectively sprayed on the skin surface. Both the numerical and experimental results indicate that the induced evaporation can significantly enhance the sensitivity of temperature mapping on skin surface over the tumor. The results also suggest that the induced evaporation method can be used to improve the diagnostic accuracy of infrared thermography, especially for tumors at early stages and/or deeply embedded.

Title: Temperature nonuniformity during applying dynamic infrared thermography for tumor detection: Impact of large vessels

Abstract: During applying infrared thermography for detection of superficial tumors, the presence of large blood vessels transmitting through the detected region and carrying blood at the systemic temperature can be an important source of temperature non-uniformity and possible misdiagnose. However, such important issue in non-invasive thermal diagnostics has received few attentions up to now. In this study, two typical vascular models are applied to probe into the impact of large blood vessels on the skin temperature profiles during applying both steady-state and dynamic infrared thermography. The results indicate that the large vessels close to the disease region can produce significant effects to the thermal images at skin surface, and that without carefully considering the impact of large vessels, both false negative and false positive diagnoses may be made. This study is expected to help realize a more accurate and quantitative non-invasive diagnoses using infrared thermography in the presence of large vessels.

Abstract: A three-dimensional (3D) simulation of bioheat transfer is crucial to analyze the physiological processes and evaluate many therapeutic/diagnostic practices spanning from high to low temperature medicine. In this paper we develop an efficient numerical scheme for solving 3D transient bioheat transfer equations based on the alternating direction implicit finite-difference method (ADI-FDM). An algorithm is proposed to deal with the boundary condition for irregular domain which could capture accurately the complex boundary and reduce considerably the staircase effects. Furthermore, the local adaptive mesh technology is introduced to improve the computational accuracy for irregular boundary and the domains with large temperature gradient. The detailed modification to ADI-FDM is given to accommodate such special grid structure, in particular. Combination of adaptive-mesh technology and ADI-FDM could significantly improve the computational accuracy and decrease the computational cost. Extensive results of numerical experiments demonstrate that the algorithm developed in the current work is very effective to predict the temperature distribution during hyperthermia and cryosurgery. This work may play an important role in developing a computational planning tool for hyperthermia and cryosurgery in the near future.

Abstract: The transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P) is an endoscopic technique and the gold standard for the surgical treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). It remains unclear if there is the possibility of electrothermal injuries of tissue which is not directly treated during bipolar TUR-P. The reason could be higher generator output powers of bipolar systems. Therefore, measured values of the power loss density distribution around a bipolar resectoscope are used as source term for the calculation of temperature changes in tissue not treated directly. The temperature calculations are based on the numerical solution of Penne's bioheat equation. With the chosen boundary conditions and input parameters no significant increase of temperature is found in the calculation domain at the proximal end of the resectoscope shaft. For a comprehensive understanding further investigations will be carried out with different boundary conditions and input parameters.

Abstract: Modeling bioheat transfer plays an important role in the treatment planning of cancer therapy. Historically, Pennes bioheat equation has been used for bioheat transfer modeling in living tissue because of its simplicity, effectiveness and ease of application. It is imperative that the effect of each parameter involved in the bioheat transfer be known. The ultimate goal of a cancer treatment is to maximize the damage to the cancer affected tissue and minimize the collateral damage to the normal tissue surrounding it. This study takes into account six 3-level factors namely blood perfusion rate in healthy tissue and tumor, frequency, applied voltage, metabolic heating rate in healthy tissue and tumor. The purpose of this study is to rank the parameters involved in electromagnetic heating and determine the factors which affect the bioheat transfer the most. Maximum obtained temperature was taken as the response variable and Taguchi orthogonal arrays were used to obtain required data with minimum number of numerical experiments required. Calculations were performed in Minitab statistical software. The results show that the applied voltage has the largest effect on the maximum achieved temperature followed by frequency of the electromagnetic radiation.

Abstract: To understand the physiology of tissue burns for successful clinical treatment, it is important to investigate the thermal behavior of human skin tissue subjected to heat injury. In this paper, a fundamental solution-based hybrid finite element formulation is proposed for numerically simulating steady-state temperature distribution inside a multilayer human skin tissue during burning. In the present approach, since only element boundary integrals are involved, the computational dimension is reduced by one as the fundamental solutions used analytically satisfies the bioheat governing equation. Further, in multi-layer skin modeling, the burn is applied via a heating disk at constant temperature on a part of the epidermal surface of the skin tissue. Numerical results from the proposed approach are firstly verified by comparing them with exact solutions of a simple single-layered model or the results from conventional finite element method. Thereafter, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to reveal the effect of biological and environmental parameters on temperature distribution inside the skin tissue subjected to heat injury.

Abstract: Cryosurgery is a surgical technique that employs freezing to destroy target tumor tissue. While the main objective during a cryosurgical procedure is to ensure tissue destruction within the cryolesion, the greatest challenge is how to spare the surrounding healthy tissues from cryoablation. In this work, a historical review of the field of cryosurgery is presented followed by a theoretical study where a mathematical model is developed for cryosurgery on a basal cell carcinoma (BCC) using liquid nitrogen (LN2) spray. The model takes into consideration the anatomic structure of skin tissue and the irregular geometry of BCC. In particular, a methodology for quantitatively determining the extent of the intracellular ice formation (IIF) zone based on the tissue temperature and cooling rate (CR) is proposed, which can directly relate to the necrosis of the cancer cells after cryosurgery. The model is then used to analyze formation of the IIF zone during cryosurgery on a BCC and quantification is provided for the volume of the final IIF zone. A parametric study is also carried out to investigate the effect of various protocol parameters on the final IIF zone. The results should be useful for dermatologists for pre-treatment surgery planning.

Abstract: A spectral element method is developed for the numerical solution of the Pennes bioheat transfer equation which models the thermal behavior of the living tissue. For the one and two dimensional cases, the implementation of this method is completely explained. In the two dimensional case, both triangular and quadrilateral elements are investigated. Through test problems, the discretization error generated from this method is reported. In the triangular elements, the error is obtained when quadrature points coincide and do not coincide with nodal points. This method is employed to solve the equation in order to obtain the temperature of the skin layers, healthy tissue, and tissue that contains the tumor. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Title: Modeling and Improvement of Breast Cancer Site Temperature Profile by Implantation of Onion-Like Quantum-Dot Quantum-Well Heteronanocrystal in Tumor Site

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate one of the important parameters (increase of infrared imaging sensitivity) in bioimaging applications that play a vital role (easy detection by nonsensitive detector) in the thermal imaging of breast cancer. It is known that differences in energy consumption exist for normal and abnormal tissue and that these differences lead to small but detectable local temperature changes if a tumor in the breast cancer is full grown. Infrared imaging has been used in tumor detection, but if the tumor is in the early stage of development, the common instrumentation is not sensitive enough to detect the subtle changes in temperature required for accurate diagnosis. Therefore, the disease can enter a dangerous stage of rapid growth. For detection of its early-stage progression, the onion-like quantum-dot quantum-well (QDQW) heteronanocrystal (CdSe/ZnS/CdSe/ZnS), for the first time, is proposed and used to increase the sensitivity of thermal detection. Indeed, the injected quantum-dots in the breast are excited by an external laser radiation source. In this study, the bioheat transfer equation is solved by the 2-D finite element approach for a simplified model of a female breast and a cancerous tumor. The results of simulations will reveal that the local temperature change detections considerably increased by using a new modified structure of quantum dot localized in tumor site.

Abstract: The Pennes bio-heat transfer equation, which introduces the exchange magnitude of heat transfer between tissue and blood, is often used to solve the temperature distribution for thermal imaging and sensing. Near-infrared light has the ability to be used as a non-invasive means of diagnostic imaging within the woman's breast. Due to the diffusive nature of light in different tissue, computational model-based methods are required for functional imaging within the breast. In this article, the time-dependent bio-heat transfer is solved by a numerical method. In our model, the heat generation source (intrinsic and extrinsic) involves laser, metabolism, and quantum dot that the metabolism and heat generated by QDs are considered as intrinsic. We supposed the injected quantum dots would target the tumor site by a passive targeting process and then by interaction of laser radiation and quantum dot, the photoluminescence of quantum dot is converted to heat in the tumor site. The extra generated heat can impact on the extracted heat profile. One of the important applications of this research has led to a sensitivity improvement of the imaging system, which is potentially useful in the diagnosis and detection of breast cancer.

Abstract: This work applies a three-dimensional lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), to solve the Pennes bio-heat equation (BHE), in order to predict the temperature distribution in a spherical tissue, with blood perfusion, metabolism and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) heat sources, during magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH). So, heat dissipation of MNPs under an alternating magnetic field has been studied and effect of different factors such as induction and frequency of magnetic field and volume fraction of MNPs has been investigated. Then, effect of MNPs dispersion on temperature distribution inside tumor and its surrounding healthy tissue has been shown. Also, effect of blood perfusion, thermal conductivity of tumor, frequency and amplitude of magnetic field on temperature distribution has been explained. Results show that the LBM has a good accuracy to solve the bio-heat transfer problems.

Abstract: This work uses the lattice Boltzmann model (LBM) to solve the Pennes bio-heat equation (BHE) to predict the temperature rise behavior occurring in cylindrical biological tissues during magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH). Therefore, LBM is extended to solve the bio-heat transfer problem with curved boundary conditions. Effect of magnetic nanoparticles' (MNPs) volume fraction as well as the vastness of heated region on the temperature distribution are shown. The analytical and numerical finite difference solutions reveal the accuracy of the model.

Abstract: The aim of the present study is to perform computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of blood flow in two coronary stents in a realistic three-dimensional geometry under physiological conditions. The two stents, similar to real coronary ones, are both made of 12 rings but are different as far as the positions of the struts are concerned. One type of stent has parallel-connectors and the other transverse-ones. Time variation of the parameters correlated to neo-intimal hyperplasia, such as wall shear stress, magnitude of wall shear stress gradient, and oscillatory shear index are investigated with the conclusion that the stent with parallel-connectors has a better fluid dynamic behavior.

Title: The effect of magnetic nanoparticle dispersion on temperature distribution in a spherical tissue in magnetic fluid hyperthermia using the lattice Boltzmann method  
Author(s): Golneshan, AA (Golneshan, A. A.); Lahonian, M (Lahonian, M.) 
Source: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYPERTHERMIA  Volume: 27  Issue: 3  Pages: 266-274  DOI: 10.3109/02656736.2010.519370  Published: 2011   
Abstract: In clinical applications of magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) for cancer treatment it is very important to ensure maximum damage to the tumour while protecting the normal tissue. The resultant heating pattern by magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in the tumour is closely related to the dispersion of MNPs. In this study the effect of MNPs dispersion on temperature distribution in a tumour and surrounding healthy tissue, during MFH, has been investigated. Accordingly, the Pennes bio-heat equation (BHE) in a spherical tissue with Neumann curved boundary condition has been resolved. The effects of blood perfusion, metabolism heat generation as well as MNPs heat dissipation in an alternating magnetic field as source term, have been considered. To solve the Pennes BHE, the three dimensional lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) has been used. To show the accuracy of the model, simulations have been compared with analytical, experimental and numerical results, reported in the literature. Then, temperature distribution within tissue has been investigated in two cases, homogeneous distribution and Gaussian distribution of specific absorption rate (SAR). Results showed that for the studied cases, unlike homogeneous distribution, Gaussian distribution of SAR is able to raise the temperature of tumour cells above the treatment temperature.

Abstract: A meshless model based on radial basis function and method of fundamental solution (RBF-MFS) is developed to investigate bioheat transfer problems. First. A time-stepping theta-method is used in handling the time variable in the Pennes bioheat equation. Then, the particular solution is approximated by a linear combination of radial basis functions, and the homogeneous solution is approximately determined by the method of fundamental solution. The multi-subdomain RBF-MFS technique is implemented for analysing problems containing different materials and/or multi-connected regions. The efficiency of the proposed method is assessed by several examples including normal tissue, tissue with tumor and burned tissue. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The experimental treatment of chosen material with laser beams, starting from continuous wave up to fs pulses, produces the necessity to find the common and sophisticated theoretical approaches to interaction modeling. For chosen materials, some laser treatment and damage analyses are performed. The provoked stresses and parameters of transport processes (penetration depth) are calculated by using the programs for electrical circuit analyses. Some inconsistencies in the treatment of large area laser-material interaction are discussed.

Abstract: A three-dimensional boundary element model of the human eye is developed to investigate the thermal effects of eye tumor on the ocular temperature distribution. The human eye is modeled as comprising several regions which have different thermal properties. The tumor is one of these regions. The thermal effects of the tumor are simulated by taking it to have a very high metabolic heat generation and blood perfusion rate. Inside the tumor, the steady state temperature is governed by the Pennes bioheat equation. Elsewhere, in normal tissues of the eye, the temperature satisfies the Laplace's equation. To compute the temperature on the corneal surface, the surface boundary of each region is divided into triangular elements. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Mathematical modeling has proven to be a viable alternative for investigating the temperature distribution inside the human eye. This is due to its ability to overcome the limitations infrared (IR) thermography; the leading method in ocular temperature measurement. A wide range of mathematical studies on the ocular temperature distribution during various conditions have been published in the literature. In this paper, we carry out an in-depth review of the various mathematical models of the eye that have been developed in the past. Various problems and the implications from the mathematical predictions of these studies are discussed. The future directions of studies in ocular temperature distribution are deliberated.

Title: STUDY OF THE BIOHEAT EQUATION USING MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS FOR LOCAL MAGNETIC HYPERTHERMIA

Abstract: Hyperthermia is a type of cancer treatment in which cancer cells are exposed to high temperatures (up to 44-45 degrees C). Research has shown that high temperatures can damage and kill cancer cells, by a localized and concentrated heating source. By killing cancer cells and damaging proteins and structures within cells, hyperthermia may shrink tumors, with minimal injury to normal tissues. Penile's bio-heat equation is used to model a heat diffusion process inside a tumor, modeled as a spherical domain with magnetic nanoparticles distributed within the diseased tissue. These magnetic particles are considered as point heat sources. Heat is generated as the result of magnetic relaxation mechanisms (Brownian and Neel relaxation) by the application of alternating magnetic fields. The Bio-Heat equation is solved using Monte Carlo techniques. Monte Carlo simulations are based on departing random walkers from the point where temperature is going to be determined. The probability in each step of the random walk is given by the coefficients of the nodal temperatures after a Finite Difference Discretization of the Penne's bio-heat diffusion equation. The main advantage of Monte Carlo simulations versus classical numerical methods lies in the possibility of solving the temperature in a specific point without solving for all the points within the domain. This feature and the fact that each random walk is independent from each other results in an easy parallelization of the computer code. Parametric studies of the temperature profiles are carried out to study the effect of different parameters like the heat generation rate, perfusion rate and diameter of the point source Oil the maximum temperature and oil the temperature profile.

Abstract: The early detection of disease especially tumor in its infant stage is extremely important for saving patient life and reducing medical cost. As is well known, an abnormal temperature on skin surface generally implies certain disease state. However, this method is still subjected to certain limitations such as low accuracy and sensitivity. Here, noticing that the human body is sweating all the time which has strong relationship with human health status, we proposed to adopt the sweating state as an effective index for disease diagnostics based on thermal infrared image mapping. Through theoretical evaluation and experimental measurement, it was discovered that, the quantity of sweating from human skin surface due to being covered by a thin film provides a significant signal for health evaluation and affects significantly the real temperature of skin surface. Through intentionally controlling the sweating, the disease can be more easily diagnosed via a far-infrared image equipment. Comparative evaluation on normal or tumor skins indicate that, if controlling sweating by covering skin with a thin film to prevent release of sweat, the temperature rise will differ a lot between these two cases, say about 2.43 degrees C vs. 4.21 degrees C. Therefore, taking account of the quantity of sweating and the final surface temperature abnormality, a better diagnostics on human disease can be expected. This offers a new auxiliary diagnostic modality and extends the working capacity of a conventional infrared thermometer.

Abstract: Recent advances in wearable sensors, as well as wireless technology and mobile computing have fostered a dramatic growth of a new generation of monitoring systems that allow one to record physiological data from individuals carrying on daily activities in the home and outdoor environments. For many applications of wearable systems, there is typically a need for achieving stable contact of the sensing elements with the skin, which requires that sensors be embedded in a fixing material (which can be an elastic bandage or a tightly-fit undergarment). However, when performing temperature monitoring in this way, measurement error may be resulted from the change of heat transfer of the local skin area by the fixing material. This study aims to disclose the effect of the fixing material on temperature measurement via skin-contact wearable sensors. The results of this study are expected to be valuable for designing wearable devices of temperature measurement.

Abstract: The Monte Carlo method is well known for solving static problems such as Laplace's or Poisson's equation. In this paper, we extend the applicability of the conventional Monte Carlo method to solve time-dependent (heat) problems. We apply the Exodus method to these problems, which is not subject to randomness, as are the classical Monte Carlo methods. We present results in one-dimensional (I-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) that agree with the exact solutions.

Title: A thermal-ablation bioheat model including liquid-to-vapor phase change, pressure- and necrosis-dependent perfusion, and moisture-dependent properties  
Author(s): Abraham, JP (Abraham, J. P.); Sparrow, EM (Sparrow, E. M.) 
Source: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER  Volume: 50  Issue: 13-14  Pages: 2537-2544  DOI: 10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2006.11.045  Published: JUL 2007   
Abstract: A new bioheat model is applied to evaluate the use of elevated-temperature thermal therapies for the non-surgical ablation of diseased tissue. The new model is based on the use of the enthalpy method to account for liquid-to-vapor phase change. In addition, the model includes thermophysical property dependence on liquid content and variations of blood perfusion rates dependent on the local necrotic state of the tissue or external pressure applied by the therapy-delivering device. This model is applied here specifically to endometrial ablation for the treatment of menorrhagia. The results of the implementation of the model yielded the depth of tissue necrosis corresponding to a given application of heat at the exposed inner surface of the uterine tissue. These results definitively establish the occurrence of phase change and the complete suppression of perfusion as the major factors governing the necrosis depth. The accounting of moisture-dependent properties had a negligible effect on necrosis. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A numerical method based on particle tracking and random walk is applied to convective heat transfer. The technique is useful in problems with high Peclet numbers in which the velocity field is known from other means. Advection is simulated by particle motion along a pathline, and diffusion by random walk. The advection time and diffusion distance determine the Peclet number. Several examples of the computation of temperature field and wall heat fluxes in advection-dominated flows for which analytical solutions are known are provided as illustrations of the method.

Abstract: Advancement of the recent micro/nano technology has stimulated the renaissance of using magnetic micro/nano particles embedded in biological tissues for the target tumor hyperthermia. As is well known, mathematical solutions of bioheat transfer involved in hyperthermia treatment are indispensable for computerized optimization of hyperthermia parameters. However, estimating the level of uncertainties associated with tissue temperature and thermal ablation area remains a major challenge. In this article, the uncertainties for the predicted temperatures of tissues due to approximate parameters were studied, based on numerical simulation of three-dimensional (3-D) quasi-steady state electromagnetic (EM field and transient temperature response in biological tissues induced by the external EM field. Contributions of uncertainty from the tissue area permeated with micro/nano particles, the concentration and size of micro/nano particles, and the frequency and strength of the external alternating EM field were analyzed, and the uncertainty limits for temperature distributions in these cases were also estimated. The uncertainty analysis presented in this article is expected to serve as a significant guide for performing a highly efficient and also completely safe tumor hyperthermia using magnetic micro/nano particles.

Source: 2006 1st IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems, Vols 1-3  Pages: 1311-1315  DOI: 10.1109/NEMS.2006.334738  Published: 2006   
Abstract: The latest generation of gigahertz-clock-rate CPUs is becoming more challenging to fit into designs. These chips are squeezing into tighter and tighter spaces with no enough places for heat to dissipate. Meanwhile, high-capacity cooling options remain limited for many small-scale applications such as microsystems, sensors and actuators, and micro/nano electronic components. This work presents a MEMS based micro cooling device, which is comprised of an active cooling substrate embedded with fluidic cooling functionality using liquid metal, to provide direct cooling to high heat flux electronics and MEMS devices. In order to better understand the cooling capability of this MEMS-based micro cooling device, the three-dimensional heat transfer process thus involved was numerically simulated. A series of calculations with different flow rates and thermal parameters were performed. Effect of different working fluids is also investigated. The results indicate that the MEMS-based cooling device has powerful cooling capability while using liquid metal as cooling fluid, and thus allow for lower operating temperatures for electronic devices and micro/nano systems.

Abstract: With improvements in infrared camera technology, the promise of reduced costs and noninvasive character, infrared thermal imaging resurges in medicine. The paper introduces a new technology of functional infrared imaging, thermal texture maps (TTM), which is not only an apparatus for thermal radiation imaging but also a new method for revealing the relationship between the temperature distribution of the skin surface and the emission field inside body. The skin temperature distribution of a healthy human body exhibits a contralateral symmetry. Any disease in the body is associated with an alteration of the thermal distribution of human body. Infrared thermography is noninvasive, so it is the best choice for studying the physiology of thermoregulation and the thermal dysfunction associated with diseases. Reading and extracting information from the thermograms is a complex and subjective task that can be greatly facilitated by computerized techniques. Through image processing and measurement technology, surface or internal radiation sources can be non-invasively distinguished through extrapolation. We discuss the principle, the evaluation procedure and the effectiveness of TTM technology in the clinical detection and diagnosis of cancers, especially in their early stages and other diseases by comparing with other imaging technologies, such as ultrasound. Several study cases are given to show the effectiveness of this method. At last, we point out the applications of TTM technology in the research field of traditional medicine.

Abstract: Large blood vessels can produce steep temperature gradients in frozen tissues, resulting in inadequate cooling temperatures during cryosurgery. In addition, blocking of blood vessels and/or bleeding due to ruptures of large blood vessels by the iceball during the cryoablation procedure may cause undesired damage to healthy tissues or organs. However, such important issues have received little attention up to now. In this article, several typical vascular models, which have been widely used in simulation of tissue temperature during tumor hyperthermia, are applied to study the effects of large blood vessels on the transient tissue temperature distributions during cryosurgery treatment. The thermal model combines the Pennes bioheat transfer equation describing perfused tissues and the energy equation for single or countercurrent large blood vessels with a constant Nusselt number. A finite-difference algorithm based on the effective heat capacity method is applied to solve these complex heat transfer problems with phase change in biological tissues embedded with large blood vessels. In the algorithm, the tissues are treated as nonideal materials, freezing over a temperature range, and the effects of blood perfusion and metabolic heat generation in the unfrozen tissues are also included. Numerical analyses are then performed to test the influence of the blood vessels on the temperature distributions of tissues. The results indicate that different vascular models produce significantly different temperature transients for a given freezing pattern. Therefore, without careful treatment planning on some specific tumors close to or with large vessels transmitting through, the final cryosurgery may turn out to fail. In other words, insufficient cooling of the targets due to heating of large and warm blood vessels may lead to the regeneration of tumor cells. This study has raised quite a few important issues in modeling the cryosurgical phase-change behavior of living tissues embedded with large blood vessels.

Abstract: Advancement of the recent micro/nanotechnology stimulates the renaissance of using. magnetic, micro/nanoparticles embedded in tissues for the target tumor hyperthermia. However, there is a strong lack of quantitative understanding of the temperature profiles thus induced by the applied external electromagnetic (EM) field, which may impede the successful operation of this therapy. In the current study, the three-dimensional quasi-steady-state EM field and transient tissue temperature behavior induced by two planar electrodes were numerically investigated. Detailed computations indicated that nanoparticles exhibit an extraordinary highly focused heating on target tumor tissue, which is much stronger than. that in the surrounding areas. This heating effect depends heavily on the properties of the magnetic nanoparticles, which may vary appreciably for,different samples depending on their particle sizes and microstructures. The effect of micro/nanoparticle concentration, heating area, and the frequency and strength of the external alternating EM field were also tested. Moreover, a criterion to determine the appropriate particle concentration thermally important for medical treatment was established. Given accurate thermal and EM parameters for cancerous tissue embedded with nanoparticles, the current model could possibly be applied in the hyperthermia treatment planning and help optimize the surgical procedures.

Abstract: Infrared imaging has frequently been used in clinics to detect changes in skin surface temperature associated with some superficial tumors. In order to accurately detect and diagnose tumors (especially in their early stages) using infrared thermography, enhancement of thermal expression on the skin over the tumor is desired. This study proposed a novel approach to effectively enhance the skin thermal expression of tumor by induced evaporation on skin surface. To illustrate its feasibility, numerical calculation was first applied to simulate the corresponding heat transfer process, from which the three-dimensional transient temperatures of the biological bodies subjected to induced evaporation were theoretically predicted. Further, preliminary infrared imaging experiments on human forearm were also performed, in which water and 75% (V/V) medical ethanol were particularly chosen to be respectively sprayed on the skin surface. Both the numerical and experimental results indicate that the induced evaporation can significantly enhance the sensitivity of temperature mapping on skin surface over the tumor. The results also suggest that the induced evaporation method can be used to improve the diagnostic accuracy of infrared thermography, especially for tumors at early stages and/or deeply embedded.

Abstract: With the sharp improvement in computational speed of CPU, thermal management becomes a major concern in the current microelectronic industry. Conventional thermal management methods for CPU chip cooling are approaching their limit for quite a few newly emerging high integrity and high power processors. Therefore, liquid metal based chip cooling method has been proposed to accommodate to this request. In order to better understand the mechanisms of the cooling enhancement by the liquid metal based cooling technique, the three-dimensional heat transfer process thus involved in the cooling chip is numerically simulated in this study. A series of calculations with different flow rates and thermal parameters are performed. The cooling capability of the liquid metal is also compared with that of the water-cooling system. The results indicate that the liquid metal has powerful cooling capability, which is much better than that of the conventional liquid-cooling system.

Abstract: During applying infrared thermography for detection of superficial tumors, the presence of large blood vessels transmitting through the detected region and carrying blood at the systemic temperature can be an important source of temperature non-uniformity and possible misdiagnose. However, such important issue in non-invasive thermal diagnostics has received few attentions up to now. In this study, two typical vascular models are applied to probe into the impact of large blood vessels on the skin temperature profiles during applying both steady-state and dynamic infrared thermography. The results indicate that the large vessels close to the disease region can produce significant effects to the thermal images at skin surface, and that without carefully considering the impact of large vessels, both false negative and false positive diagnoses may be made. This study is expected to help realize a more accurate and quantitative non-invasive diagnoses using infrared thermography in the presence of large vessels.

Abstract: Recently, a new tumor ablation modality based on freezing immediately followed by a rapid and strong enough heating has been proved to be more effective and flexible than conventional cryosurgery. In this study, a numerical algorithm based on the effective heat capacity method is established to solve three-dimensional (3-D) phase-change problems of biological tissues subject to combined freezing and heating. The accuracy of the numerical code thus compiled is validated through comparisons of the calculation results with a 1-D exact solution for a semi-infinite region solidification problem. Using the present algorithm, comprehensive analysis is performed on the freezing/thawing behavior of biological tissues with tumors. For treatment of large tumors, where strong cooling/heating power is required, a single probe will not be able to address a sufficiently large volume. For this case, freezing/heating problems using a three-probe system are solved for illustration purposes. The present algorithm is expected to be a valuable treatment-planning tool for combined cryosurgery and hyperthermia therapy.

Abstract: In non-invasive thermal diagnostics, accurate correlations between the thermal image on skin surface and interior human pathophysiology are often desired, which require general solutions for the bioheat equation. In this study, the Monte Carlo method was implemented to solve the transient three-dimensional bio-heat transfer problem with non-linear boundary conditions (simultaneously with convection, radiation and evaporation) and space-dependent thermal physiological parameters. Detailed computations indicated that the thermal states of biological bodies, reflecting physiological conditions, could be correlated to the temperature or heat flux mapping recorded at the skin surface. The effect of the skin emissivity and humidity, the convective heat transfer coefficient, the relative humidity and temperature of the surrounding air, the metabolic rate and blood perfusion rate in the tumor, and the tumor size and number on the sensitivity of thermography are comprehensively investigated. Moreover, several thermal criteria for disease diagnostic were proposed based on statistical principles. Implementations of this study for the clinical thermal diagnostics are discussed.

Abstract: The main difficulties encountered in cryosurgery are the unknowns on the extent of the irregular shape of the frozen region, the direction of ice growth, and the temperature distribution within the ice balls during the freezing process. In this study, a numerical algorithm based on the dual reciprocity boundary element method (DRBEM) is developed to solve multidimensional phase change problem of biological tissues subject to cryosurgery. The tissues are treated as nonideal materials, freezing over a temperature range, and the effects of blood perfusion and metabolic heat generation in the unfrozen tissues are also taken into account in the heat transfer model. The accuracy of this DRBEM algorithm is validated through comparisons of the calculation results with the one-dimensional numerical solutions by the finite difference method. Comprehensive analyses are performed respectively, on the freezing behaviors of normal biological tissue and diseased tissue with tumors. For treatment of large tumors where large cooling power is required, a single probe will not be able to address a sufficiently large volume. On this account, the freezing problems by two- and three-cryoprobe system are solved for illustration purpose. The present algorithm can serve as a useful tool for post-treatment planning in cryosurgery. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All fights reserved.

Abstract: Large blood vessels can produce localized cooling in heated tissues during tumor hyperthermia. This study has developed a Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate the cooling effect of large blood vessels during hyperthermia. Similar to previous formulations, heat transfer coefficients are used to calculate heat transfer of large blood vessels, and several typical vascular geometries are applied. The corresponding thermal model combines the Pennes bioheat transfer equation for perfused tissues and the energy equation for blood vessels with a constant Nusselt number. Using the Monte Carlo algorithm, numerical analyses are performed to test the influences of large blood vessels to the temperature distributions of tissues. The results indicate that during hyperthermia the presence of large vessels can be an important source of temperature non-uniformity and possible under-dosage. Reduction of blood flow through the large vessels is found to be an effective approach of reducing the localized cooling.

Title: Control of the temperature rise in magnetic hyperthermia with use of an external static magnetic field  
Author(s): Murase, K (Murase, Kenya); Takata, H (Takata, Hiroshige); Takeuchi, Y (Takeuchi, Yuki); Saito, S (Saito, Shigeyoshi) 
Source: PHYSICA MEDICA-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PHYSICS  Volume: 29  Issue: 6  Pages: 624-630  DOI: 10.1016/j.ejmp.2012.08.005  Published: NOV 2013   
Abstract: Our purpose in this study was to investigate the usefulness of a method for controlling the temperature rise in magnetic hyperthermia (MH) using an external static magnetic field (SMF), and to derive an empirical equation for describing the energy dissipation of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in the presence of both the alternating magnetic field (AMF) and SMF through phantom experiments. 
We made a device that allows for MH in the presence of an SMF with a field-free point (FFP) using a Maxwell coil pair. We measured the temperature rise of MNPs under various conditions of AMP and SMF and various distances from the FFP (d), and calculated the specific absorption rate (SAR) from the initial slope of the temperature curve. 
The SAR values decreased with increasing strength of SMF (H-s) and d. The extent of their decrease with d increased with an increase of the gradient of SMF (G(s)). The relationships between SAR and H-s and between SAR and d could be well approximated by Rosensweig's equation in which the amplitude of AMF (H-ac) is replaced by H-ac(2)/root H-ac(2) + H-s(2) except for the case when G(s) was small. 
In conclusion, the use of an external SMF with an FFP will be effective for controlling the temperature rise in MH in order to reduce the risk of heating surrounding healthy tissues, and our empirical equation will be useful for estimating SAR in the presence of both the AMF and SMF and for designing an effective local heating system for MH.

Abstract: A novel scheme to obtain the optimum tissue heating condition during hyperthermia treatment is proposed. To do this, the effect of the controllable overall heat transfer coefficient of the cooling system is investigated. An inverse problem by a conjugated gradient with adjoint equation is used in our model. We apply the finite difference time domain method to numerically solve the tissue temperature distribution using Pennes bioheat transfer equation. In order to provide a quantitative measurement of errors, convergence history of the method and root mean square of errors are also calculated. The effects of heat convection coefficient of water and thermal conductivity of casing layer on the control parameter are also discussed separately.

Abstract: Thermal analyses of biological tissues irradiated to laser-induced heat source were studied by using thermal wave model of bio-heat transfer and the Pennes model. As a model, two concentric layers of spherical tissues, a diseased tissue and a healthy tissue, with various thermal physical properties were simulated and thermal wave model of bio-heat transfer equations were solved by a hybrid scheme combined the differential transformation method and finite difference method. Three types of surface heating problems were analyzed. Finally, the thermal variations were simulated in spherical coordinate and the interface between the diseased tissue and healthy tissue of the model. Comparative studies on the traditional Pennes equation and thermal wave model of bio-heat transfer were performed and evaluated. Furthermore, temperature variations in tumor exposed to laser-induced heat were predicted depending on heat flux, elevation temperature, decaying factor and thermal relaxation time.

Abstract: Several investigators have argued that Pennes' interpretation of the vascular contribution to heat transfer in perfused tissues fails to account for the actual thermal equilibration process between the flowing blood and the surrounding tissue and proposed new models, presumably based on a more realistic anatomy of the perfused tissue. In this same direction, we introduce an exponential imprint into the thermal order parameter governing the bioheat transfer described by the Pennes model equation and then engineer the imprinted exponent suitably to generate the modified Pennes bioheat transfer model with time-variable coefficients that takes into account the dependence of blood perfusion on both time and temperature. This mathematical model uses blood perfusion to monitor and control temperature distribution in living biological tissues. We observe that all monitoring parameters interact to contribute to the control and monitoring of temperature distribution in tissues. Employing similarity and F-expansion approaches, we propose an algorithm for finding thermal traveling wave-like solutions of the model.

Abstract: In order to consider the effect of micro-structural interactions in the fast transient process of heat transport, a modified bio-heat transfer equation was developed based on the dual-phase-lag model. This work would use the corresponding equation to analyze the thermal response in a perfused tissue subjected to the spatial heating, the heat flux decays exponentially with the distance from the heating surface. In analysis process, the surface convection effect is taken into account. The modified discretization scheme based on the Laplace transform is extended to solve the non-Fourier bio-heat equation with boundary conditions. The effects of perfusion rate and relaxation times on the behavior of bioheat transfer are discussed as well as the boundary effect.

Abstract: In this paper we have investigated analytically optimal distribution of time dependent heating power Q(2)(t)(W/m(2)) in a system, described by bio-heat equation in a multilayered tissue, consisting of skin, fat, muscle and tumor layers, so as to attain a beneficial desired temperature chi* across the entire length of the tumor. The desired temperature of the tumor is achieved at the end of time of operation of the process when the surface cooling temperature is taken as constant. The spatial heating power per unit volume Q(1)(x, t)(W/m(3)) is constructed according to the well known Beer's Law [1], given by. Q(1)(x,t) = beta e(-beta x)Q(2)(t) when beta is scattering coefficient. 
The methodology adopted here is the usual 'Maximal Principal' with a suitably constructed 'Hamiltonian' followed by the use of a variant of the finite difference method [2]. 
The temperature of the tissue against its length at different total times of operation of the process due to calculated distribution of heating power is numerically evaluated for investigation of the desired rise of temperature of the tumor. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: The bioheat transfer with phase change in biological tissues during the freezing process is simulated by the dual phase lag conduction heat transfer model. A numerical algorithm based on the enthalpy method is established to solve the solidification of biological tissues. The linearly temperature-dependent enthalpy (non-isothermal phase change) is considered here. The results of the parabolic heat conduction model for a slice of cucumber are compared with the experimental data. A comparison between dual phase lag and hyperbolic solutions with small values of relaxation times is applied in order to verify the corresponding parabolic solutions accuracy of the dual phase lag and hyperbolic solutions. The heating source effect owing to blood perfusion and metabolic heat on the heat transfer in a biological tissue subject to freezing process is studied. The relaxation time has an important influence on the transient temperature and temperature gradient. A major discrepancy among bioheat transfer models is found for zones closer to the cooling boundary. The heat source term, owing to blood flow and metabolism in a phase change problem in the biological tissue, has a significant influence on thermal effects of the subject tissue.

Abstract: This paper reviews promising medical treatments which apply thermal energy to living tissues for increasing or decreasing their temperatures to therapeutic levels. The treatments are classified into low-temperature treatments (hyperthermia, cryoablation or thermal therapy, ranging from minutes to hours) and high-temperature treatments (thermal ablation treatments, ranging from seconds to minutes). Heating in biothermal systems involves three primary heat transport modes: thermal conduction, convection and radiation. The complex shapes of living vasculatures and organs make heating the target volume to a therapeutic temperature difficult. Thermal models used to describe biothermal systems are presented. The Pennes bioheat transfer equation is widely used to deal with temperature or heat associated with humans or other living creatures. Other models that describe the impact of thermally significant blood vessels (or vascular system) and blood perfusion during treatment are also introduced. Heating methods that deposit thermal energy in a transport medium (e. g., solid tumor, tissues, liquid) are highlighted. The combination of thermal therapies with other treatment modalities (such as drug treatment) is discussed.

Abstract: The hybrid method, which combines differential transformation and finite difference approximation techniques, is utilized to solve hyperbolic-type heat conduction (bio-heat) problems in one dimension. To capture the thermal behavior in a living tissue subjected to constant or exponential surface heating with the thermal wave model of bio-heat transfer, the relaxation time and the heat wave, which propagates in a direction perpendicular to the skin surface, are considered. The results show that the hybrid method can be used to solve hyperbolic heat conduction problems accurately.

Abstract: Breast thermography is a non-invasive tool for early detection of breast cancer. It was subject for many years to some controversial issues regarding its efficiency. Advances in infrared camera technology and progress in image processing systems had brought thermal breast imaging back as a valid tool for mammography. Numerical modelling of heat transfer within a woman breast is being an attractive tool that may reveal the conditions under which tumours can be detected in a thermogram. The aim of this work is to use the transmission line matrix (TLM) to model a regular three-dimensional breast with embedded tumour and analyse sensitivity parameters. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract: The infrared imaging technology is widely used in nondestructive and noninvasive imaging nowadays. The scientists and researches are showing much more interest to the expansion of this technology in medical imaging. The infrared images show a passive relationship between the body surface temperature and tissue metabolism. Determination of the metabolism rate, hyperactive region and depth from the surface temperature image is the major challenge for the researchers. In this paper a heat source model was developed for determination the depth, intensity and radius of from the surface temperature distribution may be obtained by infrared thermographs. The estimation methodology involves algorithms using artificial neural network (ANN) to map the relationship of tumor parameters to the temperature profile over the heat source model of tumor.

Abstract: Tissues have different electrical conductivity and metabolic energy consumption values depending on their state of health and species. Since metabolic heat generation values show differences from tissue to tissue, thermal imaging has started to play an important role in medical diagnoses. Temperature differences of healthy and cancerous tissue may be changed by means of frequency dependent current stimulation within medical safety limits, and thus, depth dependent imaging performance can be increased. In this study, a three-dimensional realistic model of a woman breast and malignant tissue is generated and frequency dependent feasibility work for the proposed method is implemented. Temperature distributions are obtained by solving Pennes Bio Heat Equation (using finite element method). Temporal and spatial temperature distribution images are obtained at desired depths for two cases; with and without current application. Different temperature distributions are imaged by altering the frequency of the applied current and the corresponding conductivity value. Improvement in the imaging performance can be provided by current stimulation, and the temperature difference generated by 40 mm 3 tumor at 1.5 cm depth can be detected on breast surface with the state-of-the-art thermal imagers.

Title: Relationships of skin depths and temperatures when varying pulse repetition frequencies from 2.0-mu m laser light incident on pig skin  
Author(s): Schaaf, D (Schaaf, David); Johnson, T (Johnson, Thomas) 
Source: JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS  Volume: 15  Issue: 4  Article Number: 045007  DOI: 10.1117/1.3477324  Published: JUL-AUG 2010   
Abstract: Human perception of 2.0-mu m infrared laser irradiation has become significant in such disparate fields as law enforcement, neuroscience, and pain research. Several recent studies have found damage thresholds for single-pulse and continuous wave irradiations at this wavelength. However, the only publication using multiple-pulse irradiations was investigating the cornea rather than skin. Literature has claimed that the 2.0-mu m light characteristic thermal diffusion time was as long as 300-ms. Irradiating the skin with 2.0-mu m lasers to produce sensation should follow published recommendations to use pulses on the order of 10 to 100 ms, which approach the theoretical thermal diffusion time. Therefore, investigation of the heating of skin for a variety of laser pulse combinations was undertaken. Temperatures of ex vivo pig skin were measured at the surface and at three depths from pulse sequences of six different duty factors. Differences were found in temperature rise per unit exposure that did not follow a linear relation to duty factor. The differences can be explained by significant heat conduction during the pulses. Therefore, the common heat modeling assumption of thermal confinement during a pulse may need to be experimentally verified if the pulse approaches the theoretical thermal confinement time.

Title: A review of heat transfer in human tooth-Experimental characterization and mathematical modeling  
Author(s): Lin, M (Lin, Min); Xu, F (Xu, Feng); Lu, TJ (Lu, Tian Jian); Bai, BF (Bai, Bo Feng) 
Source: DENTAL MATERIALS  Volume: 26  Issue: 6  Pages: 501-513  DOI: 10.1016/j.dental.2010.02.009  Published: JUN 2010   
Abstract: With rapid advances in modern dentistry, high-energy output instruments (e. g., dental lasers and light polymerizing units) are increasingly employed in dental surgery for applications such as laser assisted tooth ablation, bleaching, hypersensitivity treatment and polymerization of dental restorative materials. Extreme high temperature occurs within the tooth during these treatments, which may induce tooth thermal pain (TTP) sensation. Despite the wide application of these dental treatments, the underlying mechanisms are far from clear. Therefore, there is an urgent need to better understand heat transfer (HT) process in tooth, thermally induced damage of tooth, and the corresponding TTP. This will enhance the design and optimization of clinical treatment strategies. This paper presents the state-of-the-art of the current understanding on HT in tooth, with both experimental study and mathematical modeling reviewed. Limitations of the current experimental and mathematical methodologies are discussed and potential solutions are suggested. Interpretation of TTP in terms of thermally stimulated dentinal fluid flow is also discussed. (C) 2010 Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: A distributed optimal control problem for a system described by a bio-heat equation for a homogeneous plane slab of tissue is analytically investigated. The required tissue temperature at a particular location of the tumour in hyperthermia can be attained within the total operation time of the process due to induced microwave radiation which is taken as control. The tissue temperature against the tissue length at different operation time of the process is considered to attain the desired temperature of the tumor.

Title: Fundamental solutions to the bioheat equation and their application to magnetic fluid hyperthermia  
Author(s): Giordano, MA (Giordano, Mauricio A.); Gutierrez, G (Gutierrez, Gustavo); Rinaldi, C (Rinaldi, Carlos) 
Source: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYPERTHERMIA  Volume: 26  Issue: 5  Pages: 475-484  DOI: 10.3109/02656731003749643  Published: 2010   
Abstract: Methods of predicting temperature profiles during local hyperthermia treatment are very important to avoid damage to healthy tissue. With this aim, fundamental solutions of Pennes' bioheat equation are derived in rectangular, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates. The medium is idealised as isotropic with effective thermal properties. Temperature distributions due to space- and time-dependent heat sources are obtained by the solution method presented. Applications of the fundamental solutions are addressed with emphasis on a particular problem of Magnetic Fluid Hyperthermia (MFH) consisting of a thin shell of magnetic nanoparticles in the outer surface of a spherical solid tumour. It is observed from the solution of this particular problem that the temperature profiles are strongly dependent on the distribution of the magnetic nanoparticles within the tissue. An almost uniform temperature profile is obtained inside the tumour with little penetration of therapeutic temperatures to the outer region of healthy tissue. The fundamental solutions obtained can be used to develop boundary element methods to predict temperature profiles with more complicated geometries.

Title: Suitability of using far-infrared imaging system for noncontact evaluation on working state of implantable medical devices  
Author(s): Yang, Y (Yang, Yang); Wei, XJ (Wei, Xiao-Juan); Liu, J (Liu, Jing) 
Source: JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS  Volume: 105  Issue: 6  Article Number: 064701  DOI: 10.1063/1.3093868  Published: MAR 15 2009   
Abstract: The far-infrared thermal imaging is a promising noncontact way to assess the working state of an implantable medical device (IMD). The unique merit of this method lies in its direct detection of the unusual skin surface temperature distribution caused by the implanted IMD. This paper is dedicated to present a comprehensive investigation on the suitability of using far-infrared system to evaluate the thermal state at the skin surface above the implantation location of the IMD under various working, physiological, or environmental thermal conditions. It was found that an evident variation in temperature as disclosed on the skin surface is beneficial for the far-infrared thermal imaging detection. In addition, numerical simulations were also performed on three dimensional bioheat transfer problems in human bodies embedded with IMD by different implantation depth and physical characteristics. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation indicated that for a specific image system with fixed temperature resolution, when the IMD is embedded as close as possible to the superficial skin, the abnormal region of temperature on skin surface can be much more visible. Conceptual experiments either in vitro or in vivo are implemented to preliminarily demonstrate the theoretical predictions. To further improve the detection of an implanted IMD, intentional cooling by the alcohol was proposed and evaluated. Given the fact that several information of an implanted IMD can be revealed through the infrared thermograph, such noncontact imaging method could serve well as an assessment approach without causing any wound and radiation to human body.

Title: Exact analytical solution to three-dimensional phase change heat transfer problems in biological tissues subject to freezing  
Author(s): Li, FF (Li, Fang-fang); Liu, J (Liu, Jing); Yue, K (Yue, Kai) 
Source: APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND MECHANICS-ENGLISH EDITION  Volume: 30  Issue: 1  Pages: 63-72  DOI: 10.1007/s10483-009-0107-x  Published: JAN 2009   
Abstract: Analytically solving a three-dimensional (3-D) bioheat transfer problem with phase change during a freezing process is extremely difficult but theoretically important. The moving heat source model and the Green function method are introduced to deal with the cryopreservation process of in vitro biomaterials. Exact solutions for the 3-D temperature transients of tissues under various boundary conditions, such as totally convective cooling, totally fixed temperature cooling and a hybrid between them on tissue surfaces, are obtained. Furthermore, the cryosurgical process in living tissues subject to freezing by a single or multiple cryoprobes is also analytically solved. A closed-form analytical solution to the bioheat phase change process is derived by considering contributions from blood perfusion heat transfer, metabolic heat generation, and heat sink of a cryoprobe. The present method is expected to have significant value for analytically solving complex bioheat transfer problems with phase change.

Abstract: An approximate analytical solution for tissue temperature distribution in high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is obtained in this work. Based on variable separation method (VSM), the solution is performed to solve the simplified bioheat transfer equation (BHTE). Lack of enough boundary conditions; the parameters in this analytic solution are estimated using the temperature data calculated by finite element method (FEM) with nonlinear least square algorithm. The absolute root mean square error (RMSE) of temperature is 0.21 degrees C and 0.22 degrees C for two strategies, respectively. Feasibility and accuracy of the analytical solution are verified by comparison with FEM for transient temperature response in a longer time domain. The average deviation of temperature is about 0.35 degrees C. So this analytic solution is suitable to calculate spatiotemporal temperature distribution in HIFU treatment, and it is quite useful to the treatment planning.

Abstract: This study develops and solves two-dimensional convective-conductive coupled partial differential equations based on Pennes' bio-heat transfer model using low Curie temperature nanoparticles (LCTNPs) to illustrate thermal behavior quantitatively within tumor-normal composite tissue by establishing a multi-region finite difference algorithm. The model combines Neel relaxation and temperature-variant saturation magnetization derived from Brillouin Equation and Curie-Weiss Law. The numerical results indicate that different deposition patterns of LCTNP and boundary conditions directly effect the steady state temperature distribution. Compared with high Curie temperature nanoparticles (HCTNPs), optimized distributions of LCTNPs within tumorous tissue scan be used to control the temperature increase in tumors for hyperthermia treatment using an external magnetic field while healthy tissue surrounding it tumor can be kept closer to normal body tissue, reducing the side effects observed in whole body and regional hyperthermia therapy.

The attention is paid on the cases that heat mainly propagates in the direction perpendicular to the skin surface. The effects of thermal physical properties on the wave like behavior of bioheat transfer are investigated. A modified discretization scheme based on the Laplace transform is proposed to solve the present problem. The comparison between the present numerical results and those in the literature is made to evidence the present results rational and reliable. (C) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Biothermomechanics of skin is highly interdisciplinary involving bioheat transfer, burn damage, biomechanics and neurophysiology. During heating, thermally induced mechanical stress arises due to the thermal denaturation of collagen, resulting in macroscale shrinkage. Thus, the strain, stress, temperature and thermal pain/damage are highly correlated; in other words, the problem is fully coupled. The aim of this study is to develop a computational approach to examine the heat transfer process and the heat-induced mechanical response, so that the differences among the clinically applied heating modalities can be quantified. Exact solutions for temperature, thermal damage and thermal stress for a single-layer skin model were first derived for different boundary conditions. For multilayer models, numerical simulations using the finite difference method (FDM) and finite element method (FEM) were used to analyze the temperature, burn damage and thermal stress distributions in the skin tissue. The results showed that the thermomechanical behavior of skin tissue is very complex: blood perfusion has little effect on thermal damage but large influence on skin temperature distribution, which, in turn, influences significantly the resulting thermal stress field; the stratum corneum layer, although very thin, has a large effect on the thermomechanical behavior of skin, suggesting that it should be properly accounted for in the modeling of skin thermal stresses; the stress caused by non-uniform temperature distribution in the skin may also contribute to the thermal pain sensation.

Abstract: Introduction: Ultrasound is a resource commonly used in Physical Therapy. However, its inadequate application may produce insufficient heating or cause damage to biological tissues. Therefore, the knowledge on the optimum parameters for achieving the appropriate temperature, within safe limits, is necessary. Heat generation depends on equipment parameters and the physical properties of tissues. This study presented a software that simulates the energy and temperature variation in tissues over time, thus allowing users to view the heating patterns in tissues as a function of these parameters. Methods: The software was implemented based on the bioheat transfer equation for four layers (skin, fat, muscle and bone), in which the user can change the thickness and thermal or acoustic properties of these tissues. The intensity, frequency and time of application can also be chosen. Graphs showing the percentage energy absorption in relation to depth and the respective temperature variation per millimeter of tissue are presented. Results: Simulations were produced to give examples situations of interest for therapy, by varying the time of application, thickness and ultrasound frequency. Differences in heating patterns are seen, especially at the interfaces. Conclusions: The software made it possible to study the heating of biological tissues by ultrasound and can be used both for teaching purposes and for planning heating doses for continuous waves. In the future, the software will be adapted, in order to estimate which dose should be regulated in the apparatus to maintain the desired temperature for the time chosen.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to analyze the temperature distributions and heat affected zone in skin tissue medium when irradiated with either a collimated or a focused laser beam from a short pulse laser source. Single-layer and three-layer tissue phantoms containing embedded inhomogeneities are used as a model of human skin tissue having subsurface tumor. Q-switched Nd:YAG laser is used in this study. Experimental measurements of axial and radial temperature distribution in,the tissue phantom are compared with the numerical modeling results. For numerical modeling, the transient radiative transport equation is first solved using discrete ordinates method for obtaining the intensity distribution and radiative heat flux inside the tissue medium. Then the temperature distribution is obtained by coupling the bio-heat transfer equation with either hyperbolic non-Fourier or parabolic Fourier heat conduction model. The hyperbolic heat conduction equation is solved using MacCormack's scheme with error terms correction. It is observed that experimentally measured temperature distribution is in good agreement with that predicted by hyperbolic heat conduction model. The experimental measurements also demonstrate that converging laser beam focused directly at the subsurface location can produce desired high temperature at that location as compared to that produced by collimated laser beam for the same laser parameters.

Title: A novel modeling and simulation technique of photo-thermal interactions between lasers and living biological tissues undergoing multiple changes in phase  
Author(s): Dua, RJ (Dua, RJ); Chakraborty, S (Chakraborty, S) 
Source: COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE  Volume: 35  Issue: 5  Pages: 447-462  DOI: 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2004.02.005  Published: JUN 2005   
Abstract: Knowledge of heat transfer in biological bodies has many therapeutic applications involving either raising or lowering of temperature, and often requires precise monitoring of the spatial distribution of thermal histories that are produced during a treatment protocol. Extremes of temperature into the freezing and burning ranges are useful in surgical procedures for selective killing and/or removal of target tissues. For example, the primary objective of hyperthermia is to raise the temperature of the diseased tissue to a therapeutic value, typically 41-44 degrees C, and then thermally destroy it. The present paper therefore aims to develop a mathematical model for effective simulation of photo-thermal interactions between laser rays and biological tissues. In particular, damage of biological tissues when subjected to single point laser diathermy is numerically investigated using a unique enthalpy-based approach for modeling multiple phase change, (namely, melting of fat and vaporization of water content of the tissues) and the associated release/absorption of latent heat in conjunction with unsteady state heat conduction mechanisms. The governing equations of bio-heat transfer coupled with initial and boundary conditions are solved using a finite volume approach in conjunction with line by a line tri-diagonal matrix algorithm (TDMA) solver. Temperature responses of tissues subject to laser heating are quantitatively investigated in detail using the present model, and the resultant solutions are expected to be immensely useful in a variety of Bio-thermal practices in medicine and surgery.

Title: Transient solution to the bioheat equation and optimization for magnetic fluid hyperthermia treatment

Abstract: Two finite concentric spherical regions were considered as the tissue model for magnetic fluid hyperthermia treatment. The inner sphere represents the diseased tissue containing magnetic particles that generate heat when an alternating magnetic field is applied. The outer sphere represents the healthy tissue. Blood perfusion effects are included in both the regions. Analytical and numerical solutions of the one-dimensional bioheat transfer equation were obtained with constant and spatially varying heat generation in the inner sphere. The numerical solution was found to be in good agreement with the analytical solution. In an ideal hyperthermia treatment, all the diseased tissues should be selectively heated without affecting any healthy tissue. The present work optimized the magnetic particle concentration in an attempt to achieve the ideal hyperthermia conditions. It was found that, for a fixed amount of magnetic particles, optimizing the magnetic particle distribution in the diseased tissue can significantly enhance the therapeutic temperature levels in the diseased tissue while maintaining the same level of heating in the healthy tissue.

Abstract: Fractional calculus provides novel mathematical tools for modeling physical and biological processes. The bioheat equation is often used as a first order model of heat transfer in biological systems. In this paper we describe formulation of bioheat transfer in one dimension in terms of fractional order differentiation with respect to time. The solution to the resulting fractional order partial differential equation reflects the interaction of the system with the dynamics of its response to surface or volume heating. An example taken from a study involving pulsating (on-off) cooling of a peripheral tissue region during laser surgery is used to illustrate the utility of the method. In the future we hope to interpret the physical basis of fractional derivatives using Constructal Theory, according to which, the geometry biological structures evolve as a result of the optimization process.

Abstract: Heat transfer in a biological system is a complex process and its analysis is difficult. Heterogeneous vascular architecture, blood flow in the complex network of arteries and veins, varying metabolic heat generation rates and dependence of tissue properties on its physiological condition contribute to this complexity. The understanding of heat transfer in human body is important for better insight of thermoregulatory mechanism and physiological conditions. Its understanding is also important for accurate prediction of thermal transport and temperature distribution during biomedical applications. During the last three decades, many attempts have been made by researchers to model the complex thermal behavior of the human body. These models, viz., blood perfusion, countercurrent, thermal phase-lag, porous-media, perturbation, radiation, etc. have their corresponding strengths and limitations. Along with their biomedical applications, this article reviews various contextual issues associated with these models. After brief discussion of early bioheat models, the newly developed bioheat models are discussed in detail. Dependence of these models on biological properties, viz., thermophysical and optical properties are also discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title: The optimization of needle electrode number and placement for irreversible electroporation of hepatocellular carcinoma  
Author(s): Adeyanju, OO (Adeyanju, Oyinlolu O.); Al-Angari, HM (Al-Angari, Haitham M.); Sahakian, AV (Sahakian, Alan V.) 
Source: RADIOLOGY AND ONCOLOGY  Volume: 46  Issue: 2  Pages: 126-135  DOI: 10.2478/v10019-012-0026-y  Published: JUN 2012   
Abstract: Background. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a novel ablation tool that uses brief high-voltage pulses to treat cancer. The efficacy of the therapy depends upon the distribution of the electric field, which in turn depends upon the configuration of electrodes used. 
Methods. We sought to optimize the electrode configuration in terms of the distance between electrodes, the depth of electrode insertion, and the number of electrodes. We employed a 3D Finite Element Model and systematically varied the distance between the electrodes and the depth of electrode insertion, monitoring the lowest voltage sufficient to ablate the tumor, V-IRE. We also measured the amount of normal (non-cancerous) tissue ablated. Measurements were performed for two electrodes, three electrodes, and four electrodes. The optimal electrode configuration was determined to be the one with the lowest V-IRE, as that minimized damage to normal tissue. 
Results. The optimal electrode configuration to ablate a 2.5 cm spheroidal tumor used two electrodes with a distance of 2 cm between the electrodes and a depth of insertion of 1 cm below the halfway point in the spherical tumor, as measured from the bottom of the electrode. This produced a V-IRE of 3700 V. We found that it was generally best to have a small distance between the electrodes and for the center of the electrodes to be inserted at a depth equal to or deeper than the center of the tumor. We also found the distance between electrodes was far more important in influencing the outcome measures when compared with the depth of electrode insertion. 
Conclusions. Overall, the distribution of electric field is highly dependent upon the electrode configuration, but the optimal configuration can be determined using numerical modeling. Our findings can help guide the clinical application of IRE as well as the selection of the best optimization algorithm to use in finding the optimal electrode configuration.

Abstract: The influence of some therapy-relevant parameters on Laser Induced Interstitial Thermotherapy (LITT) outcomes on pancreas is assessed. The aim is to execute a sensitivity analysis for an optimal treatment strategy on in vivo pancreas. A numerical model based on Bioheat Equation has been implemented to assess the influence of laser settings (power P and energy E), applicator radius (r(f)) and optical properties (effective attenuation coefficient, mu(eff)) on temperature (T) distribution. Effects on pancreas undergoing LITT have been evaluated with a twofold approach: 1) T rise and maximum T (T-max) in tissue; 2) injured volumes (vaporized and coagulated ones). We consider parameters range in typical LITT values (P from 1.5 W to 6 W, E from 500 J to 1500 J, r(f) from 150 mu m to 600 mu m) and optical values reported in literature. Our analysis shows that, among others, P and mu(eff) are the principal influencing factors of thermal effects on pancreas undergoing LITT: P should be carefully chosen by operator to obtain the desired injured volumes, while the accurate measurement of tissue optical properties is crucial to carry out a safe and controlled thermal therapy on pancreas.

Title: The Improvement of Irreversible Electroporation Therapy Using Saline-Irrigated Electrodes: A Theoretical Study

Abstract: Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a novel therapy used to ablate tumors with high-field electric pulses applied in short durations. It is important to reduce the generation of heat in IRE to avoid the harmful effects of thermal damage. The objective of this simulation study was to examine the effects of saline irrigation in the reduction of heat upon electrodes used in IRE treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. We used a two dimensional Finite Element Model of a tumor in a liver with electrodes placed at the center of the tumor. We simulated a typical electroporation protocol with varying thicknesses and conductivities of the saline layer, and we observed the maximum temperature and the distribution of the electric field and temperature in the tissue. Our results showed that the maximum temperature in the tissue decreases with the use of saline, but the surface area of the tumor that could potentially be thermally damaged may increase with the thickness and conductivity of the saline. With the use of saline, one can achieve upwards of a 17% reduction of the maximum temperature at the electrodes. Also, the distribution of temperature and the electric field becomes more homogenous between the electrodes as the conductivity of the saline layer increases for all thicknesses of saline. We conclude that irrigating electrodes with saline may be an effective measure to enhance the efficacy of irreversible electroporation by reducing the maximum temperature at the electrodes and also improving the extent and distribution of the electric field in the tissue. However, the properties of the saline should be adjusted so as to limit the increase of thermal damage propagated in the tissue.

Abstract: This study aims to develop and verify a theoretical model to reproduce the thermal response of pancreatic tissue undergone Laser Induced Interstitial Thermotherapy (LITT). 
The model provides the evaluation of: a) ablated volumes induced by thermal ablation; b) tissue response time to irradiation; and c) heat extinction time. Theoretical volume values were compared with ex vivo healthy tissue and in vivo healthy and neoplastic tissue volume values. The theoretical model takes into account the differences between healthy and neoplastic tissue due to blood perfusion. 
Mathematical model shows that ablated volume of ex vivo healthy tissue is greater than in vivo one after the same treatment. Moreover, ablated neoplastic in vivo tissue volume is greater than healthy in vivo one, because of tumour angiogenesis. 
Ablated volume values were compared with experimental data obtained by laser treatment of 30 ex vivo porcine pancreases. Experimental ablated volume values show a good agreement with theoretical values, with an estimated increase of 61% when power increases from 3 W to 6 W, versus 46% of experimental data, and an estimated increase of 14% from 6 W to 10 W, versus 21% of experimental values. LITT could be an alternative or a neo-adjuvant treatment to surgical resection for pancreas cancer removal, and the proposed model could be the basis to supervising the evolution of ablated volumes during tumor treatment.

Abstract: Background: Despite advances in transplant surgery and general medicine, the number of patients awaiting transplant organs continues to grow, while the supply of organs does not. This work outlines a method of organ decellularization using non-thermal irreversible electroporation (N-TIRE) which, in combination with reseeding, may help supplement the supply of organs for transplant. 
Methods: In our study, brief but intense electric pulses were applied to porcine livers while under active low temperature cardio-emulation perfusion. Histological analysis and lesion measurements were used to determine the effects of the pulses in decellularizing the livers as a first step towards the development of extracellular scaffolds that may be used with stem cell reseeding. A dynamic conductivity numerical model was developed to simulate the treatment parameters used and determine an irreversible electroporation threshold. 
Results: Ninety-nine individual 1000 V/cm 100-mu s square pulses with repetition rates between 0.25 and 4 Hz were found to produce a lesion within 24 hours post-treatment. The livers maintained intact bile ducts and vascular structures while demonstrating hepatocytic cord disruption and cell delamination from cord basal laminae after 24 hours of perfusion. A numerical model found an electric field threshold of 423 V/cm under specific experimental conditions, which may be used in the future to plan treatments for the decellularization of entire organs. Analysis of the pulse repetition rate shows that the largest treated area and the lowest interstitial density score was achieved for a pulse frequency of 1 Hz. After 24 hours of perfusion, a maximum density score reduction of 58.5 percent had been achieved. 
Conclusions: This method is the first effort towards creating decellularized tissue scaffolds that could be used for organ transplantation using N-TIRE. In addition, it provides a versatile platform to study the effects of pulse parameters such as pulse length, repetition rate, and field strength on whole organ structures.

Abstract: A microfabricated electroporator (MFE) for the irreversible electroporation (IRE) of tissues has been developed by miniaturizing a clinical electroporator with a two-needle array while keeping the same electric field strength distribution. Since IRE was brought to special attention as one of the local tissue ablation techniques to treat tumors, many preclinical studies have been conducted to investigate the efficacy of IRE on animal tissues. However, some technical difficulties have been frequently encountered due to the macroscale dimension of clinical electroporators, particularly in experiments on small animal models such as the mouse or rat. Here, the MFE was proposed to solve the associated problems, resulting in time-and cost-effective experimental procedures. With the developed MFE, the effect of IRE on rat liver tissues was analyzed with time by immunohistological stainings and electrical measurement, and the experimental results were compared with those operated with the corresponding real-scale clinical electroporator.

Abstract: Pennes' equation is the most frequently employed model to describe heat transfer processes within living tissues, with numerous applications in clinical diagnostics and thermal treatments. A number of analytical solutions were provided in the literature that represent the temperature distribution across tissue structures, but considering simplifying assumptions such as uniform and linear thermophysical properties and blood perfusion rates. The present work thus advances such analysis path by considering a heterogeneous medium formulation that allows for spatially variable parameters across the tissue thickness. Besides, the eventual variation of blood perfusion rates with temperature is also accounted for in the proposed model. The Generalized Integral Transform Technique (GITT) is employed to yield a hybrid numerical analytical solution of the bioheat model in heterogeneous media, which reduces to the exact solution obtained via the Classical Integral Transform Method for a linear formulation with uniform coefficients. The open source UNIT code ("UNified Integral Transforms") is utilized to obtain numerical results for a set of typical values of the governing parameters, in order to illustrate the convergence behavior of the proposed eigenfunction expansions and inspect the importance of accounting for spatially variable properties in predicting the thermal response of living tissues to external stimulus.

Abstract: Advances in laser, microwave, and similar technologies have led to recent developments of thermal treatments for disease and injury involving skin tissue. In spite of the widespread use of heating therapies in dermatology, they do not draw upon the detailed understanding of the biothermomechanics of behavior, for none exists to date, even though each behavioral facet is well established and understood. It is proposed that a detailed understanding of the coupled biological-mechanical response under thermal agitation will contribute to the design, characterization, and optimization of strategies for delivering better treatment. For a comprehensive understanding on the underlying mechanisms of thermomechanical behavior of skin tissue, recent progress on bioheat transfer, thermal damage, thermomechanics, and thermal pain should be systematically reviewed. This article focuses on the transfer of heat through skin tissue. Experimental study, theoretical analysis, and numerical modeling of skin thermal behavior are reviewed, with theoretical analysis carried out and closed-form solutions obtained for simple one-layer Fourier theory based model. Non-Fourier bioheat transfer models for skin tissue are discussed, and various skin cooling technologies summarized. Finally, the predictive capacity of various heat transfer models is demonstrated with selected case studies.

Title: Temperature considerations during irreversible electroporation  
Author(s): Davalos, RV (Davalos, Rafael V.); Rubinsky, B (Rubinsky, Boris) 
Source: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER  Volume: 51  Issue: 23-24  Pages: 5617-5622  DOI: 10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2008.04.046  Published: NOV 2008   
Abstract: Certain electrical fields, when applied across a cell membrane, can have the sole effect of membrane permeabilization, which is referred to as electroporation. When the permeabilization is irreversible, the effect leads to cell death, primarily due to loss of cell homeostasis, in a process known as irreversible electroporation (IRE). This is an unusual mode of cell death that is not yet fully understood. However, it is unique among tissue ablation techniques in affecting only the cell membrane while tissue molecules, everything encompassing collagen structures to proteins, remain intact. This facilitates a possible immune response and avoids scar tissue formation. Irreversible electroporation is, therefore, substantially different from any other tissue ablation technique and has many advantages over either heating or freezing thermal ablation. However, since IRE employs electrical fields, it can produce thermal effects which could cause thermal damage if parameters are not chosen correctly, therapy negating the advantages of IRE. This study evaluates the temperature distribution during typical IRE protocols as a means to establish the electrical parameters that produce IRE alone, without thermal effects.

Title: Computational modeling of biomagnetic micropolar blood flow and heat transfer in a two-dimensional non-Darcian porous medium  
Author(s): Beg, OA (Beg, O. Anwar); Bhargava, R (Bhargava, R.); Rawat, S (Rawat, S.); Halim, K (Halim, Kalim); Takhar, HS (Takhar, H. S.)

Abstract: We study theoretically and computationally the incompressible, non-conducting, micropolar, biomagnetic (blood) flow and heat transfer through a two-dimensional square porous medium in an (x,y) coordinate system, bound by impermeable walls. The magnetic field acting on the fluid is generated by an electrical current flowing normal to the x-y plane, at a distance l beneath the base side of the square. The flow regime is affected by the magnetization B (0) and a linear relation is used to define the relationship between magnetization and magnetic field intensity. The steady governing equations for x-direction translational (linear) momentum, y-direction translational (linear) momentum, angular momentum (micro-rotation) and energy (heat) conservation are presented. The energy equation incorporates a special term designating the thermal power per unit volume due to the magnetocaloric effect. The governing equations are non-dimensionalized into a dimensionless (xi,eta) coordinate system using a set of similarity transformations. The resulting two point boundary value problem is shown to be represented by five dependent non-dimensional variables, f (xi) (velocity), f (eta) (velocity), g (micro-rotation), E (magnetic field intensity) and theta (temperature) with appropriate boundary conditions at the walls. The thermophysical parameters controlling the flow are the micropolar parameter (R), biomagnetic parameter (N (H) ), Darcy number (Da), Forchheimer (Fs), magnetic field strength parameter (Mn), Eckert number (Ec) and Prandtl number (Pr). Numerical solutions are obtained using the finite element method and also the finite difference method for Ec=2.476x10(-6) and Prandtl number Pr=20, which represent realistic biomagnetic hemodynamic and heat transfer scenarios. Temperatures are shown to be considerably increased with Mn values but depressed by a rise in biomagnetic parameter (N (H) ) and also a rise in micropolarity (R). Translational velocity components are found to decrease substantially with micropolarity (R), a trend consistent with Newtonian blood flows. Micro-rotation values are shown to increase considerably with a rise in R values but are reduced with a rise in biomagnetic parameter (N (H) ). Both translational velocities are boosted with a rise in Darcy number as is micro-rotation. Forchheimer number is also shown to decrease translational velocities but increase micro-rotation. Excellent agreement is demonstrated between both numerical solutions. The mathematical model finds applications in blood flow control devices, hemodynamics in porous biomaterials and also biomagnetic flows in highly perfused skeletal tissue.

Title: Skin heat transfer model of facial thermograms and its application in face recognition  
Author(s): Wu, SQ (Wu, Shiqian); Lin, WS (Lin, Weisi); Xie, SL (Xie, Shoulie) 
Source: PATTERN RECOGNITION  Volume: 41  Issue: 8  Pages: 2718-2729  DOI: 10.1016/j.patcog.2008.01.003  Published: AUG 2008   
Abstract: It has been found that facial thermograms vary with ambient temperature, as well as other internal and external conditions, and result in severe decline in the facial recognition rate. To tackle this problem, a skin heat transfer (SHT) model based on thermal physiology is derived in this paper. The proposed model converts the facial thermograms into blood-perfusion data, which is revealed to reduce the within-class scatter of face images. The advantage of the derived blood-perfusion data over the raw thermograms for recognition is analyzed by the normalized reverse cumulative histogram. It is shown that blood-perfusion data are more consistent in representing facial features. The experiments conducted on both same-session and time-lapse data have further demonstrated that (1) the blood-perfusion data are less sensitive to ambient temperature, physiological and psychological conditions if the human bodies are in the steady state; (2) for time-lapse data, the performance with the blood-perfusion data is nearly identical to that of the same-session data, while the recognition rate with the temperature data dramatically decreases in this case. The major contributions of this work are the well-grounded infrared data preprocessing and the corresponding face recognition system. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title: Effect of variable heat transfer coefficient on tissue temperature next to a large vessel during radiofrequency tumor ablation  
Author(s): dos Santos, I (dos Santos, Icaro); Haemmerich, D (Haemmerich, Dieter); Pinheiro, CD (Pinheiro, Cleber da Silva); da Rocha, AF (da Rocha, Adson Ferreira)

Abstract: Background: One of the current shortcomings of radiofrequency (RF) tumor ablation is its limited performance in regions close to large blood vessels, resulting in high recurrence rates at these locations. Computer models have been used to determine tissue temperatures during tumor ablation procedures. To simulate large vessels, either constant wall temperature or constant convective heat transfer coefficient (h) have been assumed at the vessel surface to simulate convection. However, the actual distribution of the temperature on the vessel wall is non-uniform and time-varying, and this feature makes the convective coefficient variable. 
Methods: This paper presents a realistic time-varying model in which h is a function of the temperature distribution at the vessel wall. The finite-element method (FEM) was employed in order to model RF hepatic ablation. Two geometrical configurations were investigated. The RF electrode was placed at distances of 1 and 5 mm from a large vessel (10 mm diameter). 
Results: When the ablation procedure takes longer than 1-2 min, the attained coagulation zone obtained with both time-varying h and constant h does not differ significantly. However, for short duration ablation (5-10 s) and when the electrode is 1 mm away from the vessel, the use of constant h can lead to errors as high as 20% in the estimation of the coagulation zone. 
Conclusion: For tumor ablation procedures typically lasting at least 5 min, this study shows that modeling the heat sink effect of large vessels by applying constant h as a boundary condition will yield precise results while reducing computational complexity. However, for other thermal therapies with shorter treatment using a time-varying h may be necessary.

Title: Non-Fourier analysis of skin biothermomechanics  
Author(s): Xu, F (Xu, F.); Seffen, KA (Seffen, K. A.); Lu, TJ (Lu, T. J.) 
Source: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER  Volume: 51  Issue: 9-10  Pages: 2237-2259  DOI: 10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2007.10.024  Published: MAY 2008   
Abstract: Biothermomechanics of skin is highly interdisciplinary, involving bioheat transfer, burn damage, biomechanics and physiology. Comprehension of the phenomena of heat transfer and related thermomechanics in skin tissue is of great importance and can contribute to a variety of medical applications. Due to the "lengthy" thermal relaxation tune in biological tissue, non-Fourier thermal behaviour has been experimentally observed, attracting increasingly more attention to this phenomenon. The aim of this study is to review previous researches on the non-Fourier heat transfer process and to develop a computational approach to examine this non-Fourier process and its influence on the mechanical response in skin tissue. The dual-phase-lag (DPL) model is first used to model bioheat transfer across the tissue. Together with the. thermal wave model, the non-Fourier thermomechanical behaviour of the tissue is analyzed under various surface heating boundary conditions. For single-layer tissue model, exact solutions for temperature, thermal stress and thermal damage fields arc derived; for multi-layer Structural models, numerical Solutions are obtained with the finite difference method. Large discrepancies are found to exist amongst the predictions of Pennes model, thermal wave model and dual-phase-lag model, while different DPL bioheat transfer models give similar predictions.

Title: Focal plane array based infrared thermography in fine physical experiment  
Author(s): Vainer, BG (Vainer, Boris G.) 
Source: JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS  Volume: 41  Issue: 6  Article Number: 065102  DOI: 10.1088/0022-3727/41/6/065102  Published: MAR 21 2008   
Abstract: By two examples of dissimilar physical phenomena causing thermophysical effects, the unique capabilities of one of the up-to-date methods of experimental physics-focal plane array (FPA) based infrared (IR) thermography (IRT), are demonstrated distinctly. Experimenters inexperienced in IRT can grasp how this method provides a means for combining real-time visualization with quantitative analysis. A narrow-band short-wavelength IR camera was used in the experiments. It is discussed and stated that IRT is best matched and suited to the next two test conditions-when a heated specimen is thin and when heat is generated in the immediate region of a surface of a solid. The first prerequisite is realized in the search for directional patterns of combined low-power radiation sources with the use of the IRT-aided method. The second one is realized in studies of water vapour adsorption on uneven (irregular) surfaces of solid materials. With multiple swatches taken from a set of different fabrics and used as experimental samples, a sharp distinction between adsorptivities of their surfaces is strikingly illustrated by IRT time-domain measurements exhibiting the associated thermal effect ranging within an order of magnitude. It is justified that the described IRT-aided test can find practical implementation at least in the light industry. Emissivities of different fabrics are evaluated experimentally with the described reflection method based on the narrow spectral range of IRT. On the basis of direct IR observations, attention is paid to the need for close control over the surface temperature increase while the adsorption isotherms are being measured. Sensitivity of the FPA-based IRT method, as applied to examine the kinetics of initial stages of adsorption of gaseous molecules on the solid surface, is evaluated analytically and quantitatively. The relationship between the amount of adsorbate and the measurable excess of adsorbent temperature is found. It is discovered that the method makes it possible to control nano-quantities of the adsorbed matter, namely, it is sensitive to an incipient molecular film of 1/300-monolayer effective thickness.

Abstract: Advances in laser, microwave and similar technologies have led to recent developments of thermal treatments involving skin tissue. The effectiveness of these treatments is governed by the coupled thermal, mechanical, biological and neural responses of the affected tissue: a favorable interaction results in a procedure with relatively little pain and no lasting side effects. Currently, even though each behavioral facet is to a certain extent established and understood, none exists to date in the interdisciplinary area. A highly interdisciplinary approach is required for studying the biothermomechanical behavior of skin, involving bioheat transfer, biomechanics and physiology. A comprehensive literature review pertinent to the subject is presented in this paper, covering four subject areas: (a) skin structure, (b) skin bioheat transfer and thermal damage, (c) skin biomechanics, and (d) skin biothermomechanics. The major problems, issues, and topics for further studies are also outlined. This review finds that significant advances in each of these aspects have been achieved in recent years. Although focus is placed upon the biothermomechanical behavior of skin tissue, the fundamental concepts and methodologies reviewed in this paper may also be applicable for studying other soft tissues.

Abstract: We report the first successful use of irreversible electroporation for the minimally invasive treatment of aggressive cutaneous tumors implanted in mice. Irreversible electroporation is a newly developed non-thermal tissue ablation technique in which certain short duration electrical fields are used to permanently permeabilize the cell membrane, presumably through the formation of nanoscale defects in the cell membrane. Mathematical models of the electrical and thermal fields that develop during the application of the pulses were used to design an efficient treatment protocol with minimal heating of the tissue. Tumor regression was confirmed by histological studies which also revealed that it occurred as a direct result of irreversible cell membrane permeabilization. Parametric studies show that the successful outcome of the procedure is related to the applied electric field strength, the total pulse duration as well as the temporal mode of delivery of the pulses. Our best results were obtained using plate electrodes to deliver across the tumor 80 pulses of 100 mu s at 0.3 Hz with an electrical field magnitude of 2500 V/cm. These conditions induced complete regression in 12 out of 13 treated tumors, (92%), in the absence of tissue heating. Irreversible electroporation is thus a new effective modality for non-thermal tumor ablation.

Title: Mathematical Modeling of irreversible Electroporation for treatment planning  
Author(s): Edd, JF (Edd, Jon F.); Davalos, RV (Davalos, Rafael V.) 
Source: TECHNOLOGY IN CANCER RESEARCH & TREATMENT  Volume: 6  Issue: 4  Pages: 275-286  Published: AUG 2007   
Abstract: Irreversible Electroporation (IRE) is a new drug-free method to ablate undesirable tissue of particular use in cancer therapy. IRE achieves cell death within the targeted tissue through a series of electric pulses that elevate the transmembrane potentials to an extent that permanently damages the lipid bilayers throughout the treated region. Although the IRE procedure is easy to perform, treatment planning is complicated by the fact that the electric field distribution within the tissue, the greatest single factor controlling the extents of IRE, depends non-trivially on the electrode configuration, pulse parameters and any tissue heterogeneities. To address this difficulty, we instruct on how to properly model IRE and discuss the benefit of modeling in designing treatment protocols. The necessary theoretical basis is introduced and discussed through the detailed analysis of two classic dual-electrode configurations from electrochemotherapy: coaxial disk electrodes and parallel needle electrodes. Dimensionless figures for these cases are also provided that allow cell constants, treated areas, and the details of heating to be determined for a wide range of conditions, for uniform tissues, simply by plugging in the appropriate physical property values and pulse parameters such as electrode spacing, size, and pulse amplitude. Complexities, such as heterogeneous tissues and changes in conductivity due to electroporation, are also discussed. The synthesis of these details can be used directly by surgeons in treatment planning. Irreversible electroporation is a promising new technique to treat cancer in a targeted manner without the use of drugs; however, it does require a detailed understanding of how electric currents flow within biological tissues. By providing the understanding and tools necessary to design an IRE protocol, this study seeks to facilitate the translation of this new and exciting cancer therapy into clinical practice.

Title: In vivo results of a new focal tissue ablation technique: Irreversible electroporation  
Author(s): Edd, JF (Edd, JF); Horowitz, L (Horowitz, L); Davalos, RV (Davalos, RV); Mir, LM (Mir, LM); Rubinsky, B (Rubinsky, B) 
Source: IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING  Volume: 53  Issue: 7  Pages: 1409-1415  DOI: 10.1109/TMBE.2006.873745  Published: JUL 2006   
Abstract: This paper reports results of in vivo experiments that confirm the feasibility of a new minimally invasive method for tissue ablation, irreversible electroporation (IRE). Electroporation is the generation of a destabilizing electric potential across biological membranes that causes the formation of nanoscale defects in the lipid bilayer. In IRE, these defects are permanent and lead to cell death. This paper builds on our earlier theoretical work and demonstrates that IRE can become an effective method for nonthermal tissue ablation requiring no drugs. To test the capability of IRE pulses to ablate tissue in a controlled fashion, we subjected the livers of male Sprague-Dawley rats to a single 20-ms-long square pulse of 1000 V/cm, which calculations had predicted would cause nonthermal IRE. Three hours after the pulse, treated areas in perfusion-fixed livers exhibited microvascular occlusion, endothelial cell necrosis, and diapedeses, resulting in ischemic damage to parenchyma and massive pooling of erythrocytes in sinusoids. However, large blood vessel architecture was preserved. Hepatocytes displayed blurred cell borders, pale eosinophilic cytoplasm, variable pyknosis and vacuolar degeneration. Mathematical analysis indicates that this damage was primarily nonthermal in nature and that sharp borders between affected and unaffected regions corresponded to electric fields of 300-500 V/cm.

Title: An analytical study of 'Poisson conduction shape factors' for two thermally significant vessels in a finite, heated tissue  
Author(s): Shrivastava, D (Shrivastava, D); Roemer, RB (Roemer, RB) 
Source: PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY  Volume: 50  Issue: 15  Pages: 3627-3641  DOI: 10.1088/0031-9155/50/15/010  Published: AUG 7 2005   
Abstract: To conveniently and properly account for the vessel to vessel and vessel to tissue heat transfer rates to predict in vivo tissue temperature distributions, this paper analyses two different types of Poisson conduction shape factors (PCSFs) for unheated and/or uniformly heated, non-insulated, finite tissue domains. One is related to the heat transfer rate from one vessel to another (vessel-vessel PCSF (VVPCSF)) and the other is related to the vessel to tissue heat transfer rates (vessel-tissue PCSF (VTPCSF)). Two alternative formulations for the VTPCSFs are studied; one is based on the difference between the vessel wall and tissue boundary temperatures, and the other on the difference between the vessel wall and the average tissue temperatures. The effects of a uniforrn source term and of the diameters and locations of the two vessels on the PCSFs are studied for two different cases: one, when the vessel wall temperatures are lower than the tissue boundary temperature, i.e., the vessels cool the tissue, and vice versa. Results show that, first, the VVPCSFs are only geometry dependent and they do not depend on the applied source term and the vessel wall and tissue boundary temperatures. Conversely, the VTPCSFs are strong functions of the source term and of the temperatures of the vessel walls and tissue boundary. These results suggest that to account for the vessel to vessel heat transfer rates, the VVPCSFs can be evaluated solely based on the vessel network geometry. However, to account for the vessel to tissue heat transfer rates, the VTPCSFs should be used iteratively while solving for the tissue temperature distributions. Second, unlike the tissue boundary temperature-based VTPCSFs which may become singular only in heated tissues, the average tissue temperature-based VTPCSFs have the potential to become singular in both unheated and heated tissues. These results suggest that caution should be exercised in the use of the VTPCSFs since they may approach singularity by virtue of their definition and thus may introduce large errors in the evaluation of tissue temperature distribution. Presented results are new and complementary to the previous shape factor results since these include the effect of (1) source term and (2) unequal vessel-tissue heat transfer rates from the two vessels to the tissue.

Title: Temperature dependence of tissue impedivity in electrical impedance tomography of cryosurgery  
Author(s): Edd, JF (Edd, JF); Horowitz, L (Horowitz, L); Rubinsky, B (Rubinsky, B) 
Source: IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING  Volume: 52  Issue: 4  Pages: 695-701  DOI: 10.1109/TBME.2005.844042  Published: APR 2005   
Abstract: The temperature-dependent impedivity of rat liver, transverse abdominal muscle and full skin was determined in vitro as a function of frequency across the temperature range 5 degrees C to 37 degrees C and from 100 Hz to 10 kHz. This study was motivated by an increasing interest in using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for imaging of cryosurgery and a lack of applicable data in the hypothermic range. Using a controlled-temperature impedance analyzer, it was found that as the temperature is reduced the resulting increase in tissue impedivity is more pronounced at low frequencies and that the beta dispersion, resulting from cell membrane polarization, shifts to lower frequencies. With. these new data a simple case study of EIT of liver cryosurgery was examined, using a finite-element model incorporating the Pennes bio-heat equation, to determine the impact of this behavior on imaging accuracy. Overestimation of the ice-front position was found to occur if the EIT system ignored the effects of the low-temperature zone surrounding the frozen tissue. This error decreases with increasing blood perfusion and with higher measurement frequencies.

Title: Tissue ablation with irreversible electroporation

Abstract: This study introduces a new method for minimally invasive treatment of cancer - the ablation of undesirable tissue through the use of irreversible electroporation. Electroporation is the permeabilization of the cell membrane due to an applied electric field. As a function of the field amplitude and duration, the permeabilization can be reversible or irreversible. Over the last decade, reversible electroporation has been intensively pursued as a very promising technique for the treatment of cancer. It is used in combination with cytotoxic drugs, such as bleomycin, in a technique known as electrochemotherapy. However, irreversible electroporation was completely ignored in cancer therapy. We show through mathematical analysis that irreversible electroporation can ablate substantial volumes of tissue, comparable to those achieved with other ablation techniques, without causing any detrimental thermal effects and without the need of adjuvant drugs. This study suggests that irreversible electroporation may become an important and innovative tool in the armamentarium of surgeons treating cancer.

Abstract: During applying infrared thermography for detection of superficial tumors, the presence of large blood vessels transmitting through the detected region and carrying blood at the systemic temperature can be an important source of temperature non-uniformity and possible misdiagnose. However, such important issue in non-invasive thermal diagnostics has received few attentions up to now. In this study, two typical vascular models are applied to probe into the impact of large blood vessels on the skin temperature profiles during applying both steady-state and dynamic infrared thermography. The results indicate that the large vessels close to the disease region can produce significant effects to the thermal images at skin surface, and that without carefully considering the impact of large vessels, both false negative and false positive diagnoses may be made. This study is expected to help realize a more accurate and quantitative non-invasive diagnoses using infrared thermography in the presence of large vessels.

Title: The role of porous media in modeling flow and heat transfer in biological tissues

Abstract: Flow and heat transfer in biological tissues are analyzed in this investigation. Pertinent works are reviewed in order to show how transport theories in porous media advance the progress in biology. The main concepts studied in this review are transport in porous media using mass diffusion and different convective flow models such as Darcy and the Brinkman models. Energy transport in tissues is also analyzed. Progress in development of the bioheat equation (heat transfer equation in biological tissues) and evaluation of the applications associated with the bioheat equation are analyzed. Prominent examples of diffusive applications and momentum transport by convection are discussed in this work. The theory of porous media for heat transfer in biological tissues is found to be most appropriate since it contains fewer assumptions as compared to different bioheat models. A concept that is related to flow instabilities caused by swimming of microorganisms is also discussed. This concept named bioconvection is different from blood convection inside vessels. The works that consider the possibility of reducing these flow instabilities using porous media are reviewed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Tissue electroporation is a technique that facilitates the introduction of molecules into cells by applying a series of short electric pulses to specific areas of the body. These pulses temporarily increase the permeability of the cell membrane to small drugs and macromolecules. The goal of this paper is to provide information on the thermal effects of these electric pulses for consideration when designing electroporation protocols. The parameters investigated include electrode geometry, blood flow, metabolic heat generation, pulse frequency, and heat dissipation through the electrodes. Basic finite-element models were created in order to gain insight and weigh the importance of each parameter. The results suggest that for plate electrodes, the energy from the pulse may be used to adequately estimate the heating in the tissue. However, for needle electrodes, the geometry, i.e. spacing and diameter, and pulse frequency are critical when determining the thermal distribution in the tissue. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Title: Investigating the cryoablative efficacy of a hybrid cryoprobe operating under freeze-thaw cycles  
Author(s): Zhao, X (Zhao, X.); Chua, KJ (Chua, K. J.)

Abstract: Cryoprobes are minimally invasive tools that apply extremely low temperatures to eradicate undesirable cancerous tissue during cryosurgery. At times, they may generate thermal injury to neighboring good tissue leading to the case of over-ablation. The magnitude of this problem becomes significant when tumors are complex, large size and irregular in shape. In this work, we propose a simple yet pragmatic hybrid cryoprobe which can potentially promote better surgical efficacy by improving tumor ablation while reducing undesired thermal injury to the neighboring tissue. To evaluate the performance of the proposed probe operating under cyclic freeze thaw conditions, a detailed bioheat transfer model incorporating tissue death functions was developed. In-vitro experiments conducted to validate the model yielded a good agreement of 6.7%. We numerically studied the thermal impact of employing the hybrid cryoprobe on tissue temperature distributions. Evaluating the hybrid cryoprobe's control ability, we showed that the proposed device was able to regulate the growth of the ice front while sustaining an excellent coverage of the ablation zone. We also noted the existence of a diminishing temperature effect when alternate freeze thaw cycles were applied. The performance of the hybrid cryoprobe could potentially lead to a portable and cost-effective device that may prove hugely beneficial for the purposes of surgical planning, rehearsal and control.

Abstract: A spectral element method is developed for the numerical solution of the Pennes bioheat transfer equation which models the thermal behavior of the living tissue. For the one and two dimensional cases, the implementation of this method is completely explained. In the two dimensional case, both triangular and quadrilateral elements are investigated. Through test problems, the discretization error generated from this method is reported. In the triangular elements, the error is obtained when quadrature points coincide and do not coincide with nodal points. This method is employed to solve the equation in order to obtain the temperature of the skin layers, healthy tissue, and tissue that contains the tumor. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Based on our previous study which tested the feasibility of protecting the healthy tissue around the cancerous tissue during cryosurgery by microencapsulated phase change materials (PCMs) with large latent heat and low thermal conductivity, uncertainties and sensitivities for thermal protection efficiency caused by the deviations of the PCM properties' values, the PCMs concentration and the distance between the PCMs domain and the tumor domain were further investigated in this study. The preliminary results showed that the radius of the micro/nano PCM particle, the upper and lower phase transition temperatures of the PCM and the distance between the PCMs domain and the tumor domain should be accurately measured before performing thermal protection by PCMs during cryosurgery. Less than 20 % deviations of the heat capacities of solid and liquid PCM almost had no obvious influence on the thermal protection efficiency. The results obtained in this study will further help us to optimize the protection protocol by PCMs before performing cryosurgery.

Abstract: A newly developed automatic testing system used in laboratory for diffusion pump performance measurement is introduced in this paper. By using two optical fiber sensors to indicate the oil level in glass-buret and a needle valve driven by a stepper motor to regulate the pressure in the test dome, the system can automatically test the ultimate pressure and pumping speed of a diffusion pump in accordance with ISO 1608. The uncertainty analysis theory is applied to analyze pumping speed measurement results. Based on the test principle and system structure, it is studied how much influence each component and test step contributes to the final uncertainty. According to differential method, the mathematical model for systematic uncertainty transfer function is established. Finally, by case study, combined uncertainties of manual operation and automatic operation are compared with each other (6.11% and 5.87% respectively). The reasonableness and practicality of this newly developed automatic testing system is proved. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract: This paper reviews promising medical treatments which apply thermal energy to living tissues for increasing or decreasing their temperatures to therapeutic levels. The treatments are classified into low-temperature treatments (hyperthermia, cryoablation or thermal therapy, ranging from minutes to hours) and high-temperature treatments (thermal ablation treatments, ranging from seconds to minutes). Heating in biothermal systems involves three primary heat transport modes: thermal conduction, convection and radiation. The complex shapes of living vasculatures and organs make heating the target volume to a therapeutic temperature difficult. Thermal models used to describe biothermal systems are presented. The Pennes bioheat transfer equation is widely used to deal with temperature or heat associated with humans or other living creatures. Other models that describe the impact of thermally significant blood vessels (or vascular system) and blood perfusion during treatment are also introduced. Heating methods that deposit thermal energy in a transport medium (e. g., solid tumor, tissues, liquid) are highlighted. The combination of thermal therapies with other treatment modalities (such as drug treatment) is discussed.

Title: Analytical solution of the parabolic and hyperbolic heat transfer equations with constant and transient heat flux conditions on skin tissue

Abstract: In this article, the parabolic (Pennes bioheat equation) and hyperbolic (thermal wave) bioheat transfer models for constant, periodic and pulse train heat flux boundary conditions are solved analytically by applying the Laplace transform method for skin as a semi-infinite and finite domain. The bioheat transfer analysis with transient heat flux on skin tissue has only been studied by Pennes equation for a semi-infinite domain. For modeling heat transfer in short duration of an initial transient, or when the propagation speed of the thermal wave is finite, there are major differences between the results of parabolic and hyperbolic heat transfer equations. The non-Fourier bioheat transfer equation describes the thermal behavior in the biological tissues better than Fourier equation. The outcome of transient heat flux condition shows that by penetrating into the depths beneath the skin subjected to heat, the amplitude of temperature response decreases significantly. The blood perfusion rate can be predicted using the phase shift between the surface temperature and transient surface heat flux. The thermal damage of the skin is studied by applying both the parabolic and hyperbolic bioheat transfer equations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title: Nano-Cryosurgery: Advances and Challenges  
Author(s): Liu, J (Liu, Jing); Deng, ZS (Deng, Zhong-Shan) 
Source: JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY  Volume: 9  Issue: 8  Pages: 4521-4542  DOI: 10.1166/jnn.2009.1264  Published: AUG 2009   
Abstract: In clinics, the minimally invasive freezing therapy, commonly known as cryosurgery, has been increasingly used for the controlled destruction of tumor tissue. However, there are still many bottlenecks to impede the success of a cryosurgery. One of the most critical factors has been that insufficient or inappropriate freezing will not completely destroy the target tumor tissues, which as a result may lead to tumor regenesis and thus failure of treatment. In addition, the surrounding healthy tissues may suffer from serious freeze injury due to unavoidable release of a large amount of cold from the freezing probe. To resolve these challenges, we recently proposed a new strategy, termed as nano-cryosurgery, to improve freezing efficiency of the conventional cryosurgical procedure. The basic principle of this protocol is to deliver functional suspension of nanoparticles with favorable physical and/or chemical properties into the target tissues, which then serve as adjuvant or drug carrier either to maximize the freezing heat transfer process, regulate freezing scale, modify ice-ball formation orientation or prevent the surrounding healthy tissues from being frozen. In addition, introduction of nanoparticles during cryosurgery could also help better image the edge of a tumor as well as the margin of the iceball. The new therapy raised many critical fundamental as well as practical issues for solving. This review is dedicated to present a comprehensive review on multiscale fundamental phase change heat transfer issues thus involved. Attentions would span from micro-scale heat transfer in cellular scale to tissue level. Some related thermal physical effects of nanoparticles on the freezing process such as ice nucleation enhancement, water transport during freezing of a single cell will be discussed. Cryosurgical thermal management of using nanoparticles to modify thermal properties of the tissue-particle components, regulate the growth orientation and strength of an ice ball, enable a conformal tumor destruction in tissues with or without large blood vessels, etc. will be illustrated. Meanwhile, the fundamental issue for the transport of nanoparticle and its assisted drug delivery will be summarized. Theoretical modeling as well as experimental approaches for studying the micro/nano-scale heat transfer throughout the tissue or cell domain during nano-cryosurgery will be suggested. Some potential applications and possible challenges when nanotechnology meets cryosurgery will be outlined. The nano-cryosurgery is expected to help expand the boundary of the emerging frontier of nano-biomedical engineering.

Abstract: The use of lasers in cosmetic surgery has increased dramatically in the past decade. To achieve minimal damage to tissues, the study of the temperature distribution of skin in laser irradiation is very important. The phenomenon of the thermal wave effect is significant due to the highly focused light energy of lasers in very a short time period. The conventional Pennes equation does not take the thermal wave effect into account, which the thermal relaxation time (tau) is neglected, so it is not sufficient to solve instantaneous heating and cooling problem. The purpose of this study is to solve the thermal wave equation to determine the realistic temperature distribution during laser surgery. The analytic solutions of the thermal wave equation are compared with those of the Pennes equation. Moreover, comparisons are made between the results of the above equations and the results of temperature measurement using an infrared thermal image instrument. The thermal wave equation could likely to predict the skin temperature distribution in cosmetic laser surgery.

Abstract: The ultimate aim of cryosurgery is to exactly kill all tumor cells within a closely defined region.

Such a nanoparticle-enabled cryosurgical modality is termed as nano-cryosurgery. In this study, the uncertainties for the predicted temperatures of tissues in nano-cryosurgery due to approximate parameters were investigated. Contributions of uncertainties from the tissue area permeated with nanoparticles, the concentration of nanoparticles, and the thermal parameters of tissues were respectively analyzed, and the uncertainty limits for temperature distributions in these cases were also estimated. The uncertainty analysis presented in this study is expected to serve as a significant guide for performing a highly efficient and also completely safe nano-cryosurgical treatment.

Abstract: A minimally invasive approach was proposed to measure local blood perfusion rate in living tissues, based on the well-known Pennes bioheat equation. The measuring probe consists of a heater covered with conductive epoxy and temperature sensor deposited on the probe-tissue interface. By monitoring the probe-tissue interface's temperature response before and after employing the constant heat flux, the tissue blood perfusion rate can be obtained. A theoretical model was developed to describe the measurement system. In vivo experiments were performed on the rabbit's thighs to validate this method. At last, uncertainties implied in the temperature measurement and voltage across the heater was evaluated. The results point out the way to improve the accuracy of the present method and its appropriate application occasion.

Title: Analytical analysis of the Pennes bioheat transfer equation with sinusoidal heat flux condition on skin surface

Abstract: This study focuses on the effect of the temperature response of a semi-infinite biological tissue due to a sinusoidal heat flux at the skin. The Pennes bioheat transfer equation such as rho(t)c(t)(partial derivative T/partial derivative t) + W(b)c(b)(T-T-a) = k partial derivative T-2/partial derivative x(2) with the oscillatory heat flux boundary condition such as q(0,t)=q(0)e(iwt) was investigated. By using the Laplace transform, the analytical solution of the Pennes bioheat transfer equation with surface sinusoidal heating condition is found. This analytical expression is suitable for describing the transient temperature response of tissue for the whole time domain from the starting periodic oscillation to the final steady periodic oscillation. The results show that the temperature oscillation due to the sinusoidal heating on the skin surface is unstable in the initial period. Further, it is unavailable to predict the blood perfusion rate via the phase shifting between the surface heat flux and the surface temperature. Moreover, the lower frequency of sinusoidal heat flux on the skin surface induces a more sensitive phase shift response to the blood perfusion rate change, but extends the beginning time of sampling because of the avoidance of the unavailable first cyclic oscillation.

Abstract: Advancement of the recent micro/nano technology has stimulated the renaissance of using magnetic micro/nano particles embedded in biological tissues for the target tumor hyperthermia. As is well known, mathematical solutions of bioheat transfer involved in hyperthermia treatment are indispensable for computerized optimization of hyperthermia parameters. However, estimating the level of uncertainties associated with tissue temperature and thermal ablation area remains a major challenge. In this article, the uncertainties for the predicted temperatures of tissues due to approximate parameters were studied, based on numerical simulation of three-dimensional (3-D) quasi-steady state electromagnetic (EM field and transient temperature response in biological tissues induced by the external EM field. Contributions of uncertainty from the tissue area permeated with micro/nano particles, the concentration and size of micro/nano particles, and the frequency and strength of the external alternating EM field were analyzed, and the uncertainty limits for temperature distributions in these cases were also estimated. The uncertainty analysis presented in this article is expected to serve as a significant guide for performing a highly efficient and also completely safe tumor hyperthermia using magnetic micro/nano particles.

Title: Regional temperature changes in the brain during somatosensory stimulation

Abstract: Time-dependent variations in the brain temperature (T-t) are likely to be caused by fluctuations of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxidative consumption (CMRO2), both of which are seemingly coupled to alterations in neuronal activity. We combined magnetic resonance, optical imaging, temperature sensing, and electrophysiologic methods in alpha-chloralose anesthetized rats to obtain multimodal measurements during forepaw stimulation. Localized changes in neuronal activity were colocalized with regional increases in T-t (by similar to 0.2%), CBF (by similar to 95%), and CMRO2 (by similar to 73%). The time-to-peak for T-t (42 +/- 11 secs) was significantly longer than those for CBF and CMRO2 (5 +/- 2 and 18 +/- 4 secs, respectively) with a 2-min stimulation. Net heat in the region of interest (ROI) was modeled as being dependent on the sum of heats attributed to changes in CMRO2 (Q(m)) and CBF (Q(f)) as well as conductive heat loss from the ROI to neighboring regions (Q(c)) and to the environment (Q(e)). Although tissue cooling because of Qf and Qc can occur and are enhanced during activation, the net increase in T-t corresponded to a large rise in Qm, whereas effects of Qe can be ignored. The results show that T-t increases slowly (by similar to 0.1 degrees C) during physiologic stimulation in alpha-chloralose anesthetized rats. Because the potential cooling effect of CBF depends on the temperature of blood entering the brain, T-t is mainly affected by CMRO2 during functional challenges. Implications of these findings for functional studies in awake humans and temperature regulation are discussed.

Abstract: A numerical model is developed to study the electromagnetic and thermal responses of normal and cancerous tissues under microwave hyperthermia. The numerical model is 3-D dimensional with full integration of electromagnetic and thermal phenomena. The model development employs a finite difference time domain (FDTD) method for electromagnetic calculations and an implicit transient node finite element (FEM) method for thermal calculations. The multi-scale microwave-propagation and thermal diffusion phenomena are coupled either directly or indirectly, depending up of the properties of the tissues. The calculated quantities include the absorbed source distribution, heating pattern, and temperature distributions within the tissues consisting of skin, fat, muscle and blood flows. The calculated results are compared with experimental measurements.

Abstract: A three-dimensional model is presented for the quantitative prediction of skin injury resulting from certain thermal exposure on the surface. The model is based on the skin damage equation proposed by Henriques and Moritz for the process of protein denaturation. Different from the standard Arrhenius model for protein damage rate, in which the activation energy includes chemical reaction only, strain energy of tissue due to thermal stress is also considered in the current model. Skin thermal response is modeled using the bioheat transfer equation by including water diffusion on the skin surface, and the corresponding thermal stress is predicted using the modified Duhamel-Neuman equation. Strain energy is then obtained by the stress-strain relation. The extent of burn injury is computed from the transient temperature solution and the effect of strain energy on skin damage is investigated. The time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) are discretized using Crank-Nicholson finite difference scheme and the resulting sparse linear systems are solved iteratively.

Abstract: Temperature is a long established indicator of health. With the advancement of clinical medicine in thermal disease diagnostics, understanding the thermal life phenomena and temperature behavior has become increasingly important. The biological effects of human exposure to low-intensity laser irradiation thermo-therapy, the best established are those due to elevation of tissue temperature. Bio-heat equations (BHEs) are necessary for predicting tissue temperature during thermal treatment. To prevent harmful levels of heating, restrictions have been proposed on low-intensity laser irradiation as the external spatial heating. In this paper, considering the different properties for the pathological tissue and the normal tissue, using a numerical method to solve the Pennes' bio-heat equation, we analyzed theoretically the relationship between the temperature distribution and external spatial heating during low-intensity laser irradiation. The effects of the thermal parameters such as the heat conductivity, blood perfusion rate, and metabolic rate of the tissues on the temperature distribution were discussed. The results can be used to predicted different effects on the temperature variation and distribution, the thermal damage distribution and the thermal damage volume etc. The results are also useful in optimizing the therapeutic parameters for improved low-intensity laser irradiation treatments and for better understanding the thermal life phenomena in living tissues.

Abstract: As a newly emerging virus, little is known about the SARS coronavirus, whose outbreak has brought away several hundred people's lives over the world in the year of 2003 and is seriously imperiling the human health. Revealing the denaturation and replication mechanisms of SARS coronavirus has great importance for successfully fighting SARS. However, experiments related to SARS coronavirus are extremely dangerous and therefore restricted only to certain specific labs with high safety standard. Clearly, predicting the behaviors of SARS coronavirus in a wide variety of environmental conditions, which are not easily accessible, are thus critically necessary. In this study, we proposed to quantify the survival time of SARS coronavirus either in vitro or in vivo, through introducing thermal rate process models established from the well-known Arrhenius law. The complex physical and chemical behaviors of the SARS coronavirus can then be attributed to its activation energy, frequency factor, damage function as well as the surrounding environmental conditions. Based on the first data on stability and resistance of SARS coronavirus measured by members of WHO laboratory network, the rate coefficients involved in the above equations were estimated for the first time. Predictions on the survival time of SARS coronavirus in different temperature scale were then performed. It was found theoretically that, such survival time falls in an extremely wide range, say from several seconds in high temperature to an almost infinitely long time in a low temperature environment, which has already or is being supported by the currently available tests data. Applications of the present theory to interpret several existing phenomena were presented and their implementations in developing new technical ways for SARS prevention and clinical therapy were discussed. Uncertainties involved in the theoretical models were also analyzed and predicted. Parametric studies were performed to test the effects of the rate coefficients to the survival time of SARS coronavirus. Some important factors, which can significantly vary the denaturation or replication process of SARS coronavirus were pointed out. Through regulating the parameters involved in the equation, certain potential therapies either through drug delivery or engineering approach to treat the SARS disease can possibly be established. Extension of the present model for further studies was also suggested. This study opens a new theoretical way for probing into the complex behaviors of SARS coronavirus.

Title: A new stochastic approach to transient heat conduction modeling with uncertainty  
Author(s): Xiu, DB (Xiu, DB); Karniadakis, GE (Karniadakis, GE) 
Source: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER  Volume: 46  Issue: 24  Pages: 4681-4693  DOI: 10.1016/S0017-9310(03)00299-0  Published: NOV 2003   
Abstract: We present a generalized polynomial chaos algorithm for the solution of transient heat conduction subject to uncertain inputs, i.e. random heat conductivity and capacity. The stochastic input and solution are represented spectrally by the orthogonal polynomial functionals from the Askey scheme, as a generalization of the original polynomial chaos idea of Wiener [Am. J. Math. 60 (1938) 897]. A Galerkin projection in random space is applied to derive the equations in the weak form. The resulting set of deterministic equations is subsequently discretized by the spectral/hp element method in physical space and integrated in time. Numerical examples are given and the convergence of the chaos expansion is demonstrated for a model problem. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract: In this study, an inverse algorithm based on the conjugate gradient method and the discrepancy principle is applied to solve the inverse hyperbolic heat conduction problem in estimating the unknown time-dependent surface heat flux in a living skin tissue from the temperature measurements taken within the tissue. The inverse solutions will be justified based on the numerical experiments in which three different heat flux distributions are to be determined. The temperature data obtained from the direct problem are used to simulate the temperature measurements. The influence of measurement errors upon the precision of the estimated results is also investigated. Results show that an excellent estimation on the time-dependent surface heat flux can be obtained for the test cases considered in this study. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Abstract: Purpose - In this study, the purpose was to introduce two-dimensional hyperbolic heat conduction equations in order to simulate the fast precooling process of a cylindrically shaped food product with internal heat generation. A modified model for internal heat generation due to respiration in the food product was proposed to take the effect of relaxation time into account. The obtained governing equations were solved numerically using an efficient finite difference technique. The influence of Biot number and heat generation parameters on thermal characteristics was examined and discussed. The results based on hyperbolic model were compared with the classical parabolic heat diffusion model. The present numerical code was validated via comparison with analytical solution and a good agreement was found.

Title: VARIATIONAL ITERATION METHOD FOR THERMAL DIFFUSION AND DIFFUSION THERMO EFFECTS OF THIXOTROPIC FLUID THROUGH BIOLOGICAL TISSUES WITH LASER RADIATION EXISTENCE  
Author(s): Elsa, AF (Elsa, Assma F.) 
Source: JOURNAL OF POROUS MEDIA  Volume: 16  Issue: 4  Pages: 277-289  Published: 2013   
Abstract: Thermal diffusion and diffusion thermoeffects on the thixotropic fluid obeying Harris rheological model with laser applications through biological tissues have been modeled by using a group of partial nonlinear differential equations with appropriate boundary conditions. The system of nonlinear partial differential equations describing the momentum, energy, mass, and bioheat transfer has been solved by using a variational iteration method. The distributions of the fluid temperature and concentration are obtained as a function of physical parameters of the fluid. During the course of discussion the tissue temperatures, shear stress, and fluid pressure are also obtained. The effects of the problem parameters on these solutions are discussed numerically and illustrated by a set of figures.

Abstract: In this paper a new fractional thermal wave model of the bioheat transfer (FTWMBT) caused by spatial heating is built using Taylor's series expansion of modified Riemann-Liouville fractional derivatives. A one-dimensional analytical solution of the FTWMBT in a finite medium is obtained. The FTWMBT in the case (alpha = 1) interpolates the standard thermal wave model of bioheat transfer and the well-known Pennes' bioheat equation (tau = 0). Finally, numerical results are presented graphically for various values of different parameters. This study demonstrates that fractional models can provide a unified approach to examine the heat transfer in biological tissue.

Title: Analytical solution of the parabolic and hyperbolic heat transfer equations with constant and transient heat flux conditions on skin tissue  
Author(s): Ahmadikia, H (Ahmadikia, H.); Fazlali, R (Fazlali, R.); Moradi, A (Moradi, A.)

Abstract: In this article, the parabolic (Pennes bioheat equation) and hyperbolic (thermal wave) bioheat transfer models for constant, periodic and pulse train heat flux boundary conditions are solved analytically by applying the Laplace transform method for skin as a semi-infinite and finite domain. The bioheat transfer analysis with transient heat flux on skin tissue has only been studied by Pennes equation for a semi-infinite domain. For modeling heat transfer in short duration of an initial transient, or when the propagation speed of the thermal wave is finite, there are major differences between the results of parabolic and hyperbolic heat transfer equations. The non-Fourier bioheat transfer equation describes the thermal behavior in the biological tissues better than Fourier equation. The outcome of transient heat flux condition shows that by penetrating into the depths beneath the skin subjected to heat, the amplitude of temperature response decreases significantly. The blood perfusion rate can be predicted using the phase shift between the surface temperature and transient surface heat flux. The thermal damage of the skin is studied by applying both the parabolic and hyperbolic bioheat transfer equations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title: Modeling Bioheat Transport at Macroscale

Source: JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME  Volume: 133  Issue: 1  Special Issue: SI  Article Number: 011010  DOI: 10.1115/1.4002361  Published: JAN 2011   
Abstract: Macroscale thermal models have been developed for biological tissues either by the mixture theory of continuum mechanics or by the porous-media theory. The former uses scaling-down from the global scale; the latter applies scaling-up from the microscale by the volume averaging. The used constitutive relations for heat flux density vector include the Fourier law, the Cattaneo-Vernotte (Cattaneo, C., 1958, "A Form of Heat Conduction Equation Which Eliminates the Paradox of Instantaneous Propagation," Compt. Rend., 247, pp. 431-433; Vernotte, P., 1958, "Les Paradoxes de la Theorie Continue de I'equation de la Chaleur," Compt. Rend., 246, pp. 3154-3155) theory, and the dual-phase-lagging theory. The developed models contain, for example, the Pennes (1948, "Analysis of Tissue and Arterial Blood Temperature in the Resting Human Forearm," J. Appl. Physiol., 1, pp. 93-122), Wulff (1974, "The Energy Conservation Equation for Living Tissues," IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng., BME-21, pp. 494-495), Klinger (1974, "Heat Transfer in Perfused Tissue I: General Theory," Bull. Math. Biol., 36, pp. 403415), and Chen and Holmes (1980, "Microvascular Contributions in Tissue Heat Transfer," Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 335, pp. 137-150), thermal wave bioheat, dual-phase-lagging (DPL) bioheat, two-energy-equations, blood DPL bioheat, and tissue DPL bioheat models. We analyze the methodologies involved in these two approaches, the used constitutive theories for heat flux density vector and the developed models. The analysis shows the simplicity of the mixture theory approach and the powerful capacity of the porous-media approach for effectively developing accurate macroscale thermal models for biological tissues. Future research is in great demand to materialize the promising potential of the porous-media approach by developing a rigorous closure theory. The heterogeneous and nonisotropic nature of biological tissue yields normally a strong noninstantaneous response between heat flux and temperature gradient in nonequilibrium heat transport. Both blood and tissue macroscale temperatures satisfy the DPL-type energy equations with the same values of the phase lags of heat flux and temperature gradient that can be computed in terms of blood and tissue properties, blood-tissue interfacial convective heat transfer coefficient, and blood perfusion rate. The blood-tissue interaction leads to very sophisticated effect of the interfacial convective heat transfer, the blood velocity, the perfusion, and the metabolic reaction on blood and tissue macroscale temperature fields such as the spreading of tissue metabolic heating effect into the blood DPL bioheat equation and the appearance of the convection term in the tissue DPL bioheat equation due to the blood velocity.

Abstract: A mathematical model for skin burn injury induced by radiation heating, where the skin was considered to be a 3-D triple-layered structure with embedded three-level dendritic countercurrent vascular network, has been developed. Since there are up to seven levels of arteries and veins, the motivation of this study is to extend the model to a more complex case that considers a seven-level dendritic countercurrent vascular network, where the dimensions and blood flow of the blood vessels are determined based on the constructal theory of multi-scale tree-shaped heat exchangers. The method is illustrated by an example.

Title: A New Accurate Finite-Difference Scheme for the Thermal Analysis of One-Dimensional Microspheres Exposed to Ultrashort-Pulsed Lasers  
Author(s): Dai, WZ (Dai, Weizhong); Johnson, C (Johnson, Connor)

Abstract: Ultrashort-pulsed lasers with pulse durations of the order of subpicoseconds to femtoseconds possess exclusive capabilities in limiting the undesirable spread of the thermal process zone in the heated sample. Parabolic two-step micro heat transport equations have been widely applied for thermal analysis of thin metallic films exposed to ultrashort laser pulses. In this study, we develop a higher-order-accurate compact finite-difference scheme for solving the heat transport equations in a one-dimensional microsphere exposed to ultrashort-pulsed lasers, where the boundary is assumed to be thermally insulated. The method is illustrated by two numerical examples.

Abstract: Advances in laser, microwave, and similar technologies have led to recent developments of thermal treatments for disease and injury involving skin tissue. In spite of the widespread use of heating therapies in dermatology, they do not draw upon the detailed understanding of the biothermomechanics of behavior, for none exists to date, even though each behavioral facet is well established and understood. It is proposed that a detailed understanding of the coupled biological-mechanical response under thermal agitation will contribute to the design, characterization, and optimization of strategies for delivering better treatment. For a comprehensive understanding on the underlying mechanisms of thermomechanical behavior of skin tissue, recent progress on bioheat transfer, thermal damage, thermomechanics, and thermal pain should be systematically reviewed. This article focuses on the transfer of heat through skin tissue. Experimental study, theoretical analysis, and numerical modeling of skin thermal behavior are reviewed, with theoretical analysis carried out and closed-form solutions obtained for simple one-layer Fourier theory based model. Non-Fourier bioheat transfer models for skin tissue are discussed, and various skin cooling technologies summarized. Finally, the predictive capacity of various heat transfer models is demonstrated with selected case studies.

Abstract: Biothermomechanics of skin is highly interdisciplinary, involving bioheat transfer, burn damage, biomechanics and physiology. Comprehension of the phenomena of heat transfer and related thermomechanics in skin tissue is of great importance and can contribute to a variety of medical applications. Due to the "lengthy" thermal relaxation tune in biological tissue, non-Fourier thermal behaviour has been experimentally observed, attracting increasingly more attention to this phenomenon. The aim of this study is to review previous researches on the non-Fourier heat transfer process and to develop a computational approach to examine this non-Fourier process and its influence on the mechanical response in skin tissue. The dual-phase-lag (DPL) model is first used to model bioheat transfer across the tissue. Together with the. thermal wave model, the non-Fourier thermomechanical behaviour of the tissue is analyzed under various surface heating boundary conditions. For single-layer tissue model, exact solutions for temperature, thermal stress and thermal damage fields arc derived; for multi-layer Structural models, numerical Solutions are obtained with the finite difference method. Large discrepancies are found to exist amongst the predictions of Pennes model, thermal wave model and dual-phase-lag model, while different DPL bioheat transfer models give similar predictions.

Abstract: Ultrashort pulsed lasers have been attracting worldwide interest in science and engineering communities. Studying the thermal deformation induced by ultrashort pulsed lasers is important for preventing thermal damage. This article presents a new numerical method for studying thermal deformation in a 3D thin film exposed to ultrashort pulsed lasers. The method is obtained based on the parabolic two-step model and implicit finite difference schemes on a staggered mesh. It accounts for the coupling effect between lattice temperature and strain rate, as well as for the hot electron-blast effect in momentum transfer. In particular, a fourth-order compact scheme is developed for evaluating those stress derivatives in the dynamic equations of motion. The method allows Lis to avoid non-physical oscillations in the solution. Its performance is demonstrated by a numerical example. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title: Non-Fourier heat conduction effect on laser-induced thermal damage in biological tissues  
Author(s): Zhou, JH (Zhou, Jianhua); Zhang, YW (Zhang, Yuwen); Chen, JK (Chen, J. K.) 
Source: NUMERICAL HEAT TRANSFER PART A-APPLICATIONS  Volume: 54  Issue: 1  Pages: 1-19  DOI: 10.1080/10407780802025911  Published: 2008   
Abstract: To ensure personal safety and improve treatment efficiency in laser medical applications, one of the most important issues is to understand and accurately assess laser-induced thermal damage to biological tissues. Biological tissues generally consist of nonhomogeneous inner structures, in which heat flux equilibrates to the imposed temperature gradient via a relaxation phenomenon characterized by a thermal relaxation time. Therefore, it is naturally expected that assessment of thermal damage to tissues could be inaccurate when a classical bioheat conduction model is employed. However, little attention has been given to studying the impact of the bioheat non-Fourier effect. In this article, a thermal wave model of bioheat transfer, together with a seven-flux model for light propagation and a rate process equation for tissue damage, is presented to investigate thermal damage in biological tissues. It is shown that the thermal damage assessed with the thermal wave bioheat model may differ significantly from that assessed with the classical bioheat model. Without including the bioheat non-Fourier effect, the assessment of thermal damage to biological tissue may not be reliable.

Author(s): Du, XD (Du, Xudong); Dai, WZ (Dai, Weizhong); Wang, P (Wang, Pan) 
Source: NUMERICAL HEAT TRANSFER PART A-APPLICATIONS  Volume: 53  Issue: 5  Pages: 457-484  DOI: 10.1080/10407780701632742  Published: 2008   
Abstract: Studying the thermal deformation induced by ultrashort pulsed lasers is important for preventing thermal damage. This article presents a numerical method for studying thermal deformation in a 3-D microsphere exposed to ultrashort pulsed lasers. The method is obtained based on the parabolic two-step model and implicit finite-difference scheme on a staggered grid. In particular, a fourth-order compact scheme is developed for evaluating those stress derivatives in the dynamic equations of motion. The method allows us to avoid nonphysical oscillations in the solution. Its performance is demonstrated by a numerical example.

Title: A finite difference method for studying thermal deformation in a double-layered thin film exposed to ultrashort pulsed lasers  
Author(s): Wang, HJ (Wang, Haojie); Dai, WZ (Dai, Weizhong); Melnik, R (Melnik, Roderick) 
Source: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES  Volume: 45  Issue: 12  Pages: 1179-1196  DOI: 10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2006.03.001  Published: DEC 2006   
Abstract: Ultrashort pulsed lasers have been attracting worldwide interest in science and engineering because the lasers with pulse durations of order of sub-picoseconds to femtoseconds possess exclusive capabilities in limiting the undesirable spread of the thermal process zone in the heated sample. It is important to study the thermal deformation induced by ultrashort pulsed lasers to prevent thermal damage. In this article, we apply a staggered finite difference method to study thermal deformation in a two-dimensional double-layered metal film exposed to ultrashort pulsed lasers. The method is obtained based on the parabolic two-step heat transport equations. It accounts for the coupling effect between lattice temperature and strain rate, as well as for the hot-electron blast effect in momentum transfer. The developed methodology allows us to avoid non-physical oscillations in the solution as demonstrated by a series of numerical experiments. (C) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Title: A finite difference scheme for solving parabolic two-step micro-heat transport equations in a double-layered micro-sphere heated by ultrashort-pulsed lasers  
Author(s): Dai, WZ (Dai, Weizhong); Li, G (Li, Guang) 
Source: NUMERICAL METHODS FOR PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS  Volume: 22  Issue: 6  Pages: 1396-1417  DOI: 10.1002/num.20162  Published: NOV 2006   
Abstract: Ultrashort-pulsed lasers with pulse durations of the order of sub-picosecond to femtosecond domain possess exclusive capabilities in limiting the undesirable spread of the thermal process zone in the heated sample. Parabolic two-step micro heat transport equations have been widely applied for thermal analysis of thin metal films exposed to picosecond thermal pulses. In this study, we develop a three-level finite difference scheme for solving the micro heat transport equations in a double-layered micro sphere. It is shown by the discrete energy method that the scheme is unconditionally stable. Numerical results for thermal analysis of a gold layer coated on a chromium padding layer are obtained.

Abstract: In recent years there has been interest in research related to hyperthermia combined with radiation and cytotoxic drugs to enhance the killing of tumors. When heating the tumor tissue, the crucial problem is keeping the temperature of the normal tissue surrounding the tumor below a certain threshold so as not to cause damage to the tissue. Hence, in order to control the process, it is important to obtain a temperature field of the entire treatment region. Recently, we have developed a numerical method for obtaining an optimal temperature distribution in a triple-layered skin structure. In this article, we extend our study to a triple-layered skin structure embedded with multilevel blood vessels, and develop a numerical method for obtaining an optimal temperature distribution.

Abstract: It is of interest to research hyperthermia combined with radiation and cytotoxic drugs to enhance the killing of tumors. The crucial problem is to keep surrounding normal tissue below a temperature that will produce harm when heating the tumor tissue. In this study, we develop a numerical model for optimizing laser power in the irradiation of a 3-D triple-layered cylindrical skin structure. The method determines the required laser intensity in order to obtain prespecified temperatures at given locations on the skin surface after a prespecified laser exposure time.

Title: Preparation and characterization of antimony-doped tin dioxide electrodes. 3. XPS and SIMS characterization

Abstract: Several antimony- and antimony-platinum-doped tin dioxide electrodes supported on titanium have been characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for surface analysis and secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) for in-depth profile analysis. The surface analysis of the freshly prepared electrodes indicates that the Sb/Sn ratio in the electrode surface is similar to the nominal composition in the precursor solution, but the amount of Pt is higher than this nominal composition. The presence of platinum also produces the segregation of Sb near the electrode surface. The anodic polarization treatment of the electrode produces changes in its chemical state. The growth of a passivating hydroxide in the outer layer is the main cause of the deactivation of Ti/SnO2-Sb electrodes. The introduction of platinum in the layer prevents the hydroxide formation and modifies the deactivation mechanism of the electrode. The growth of an isolating TiO2 between the support and the active oxide produces the deactivation of Ti/SnO2-Sb-Pt electrodes.

Title: A stable and convergent three-level finite difference scheme for solving a dual-phase-lagging heat transport equation in spherical coordinates

Abstract: Heat transport at the microscale is of vital importance in microtechnology applications. The heat transport equation is different from the traditional heat diffusion equation since a second-order derivative of temperature with respect to time and a third-order mixed derivative of temperature with respect to space and time are introduced. In this study, we consider the heat transport equation in spherical coordinates and develop a three level finite difference scheme for solving the heat transport equation in a microsphere. It is shown that the scheme is unconditionally stable and convergent. The method is illustrated by two numerical examples. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title: Non-Fourier heat conduction effect on prediction of temperature transients and thermal stress in skin cryopreservation  
Author(s): Deng, ZS (Deng, ZS); Liu, J (Liu, J) 
Source: JOURNAL OF THERMAL STRESSES  Volume: 26  Issue: 8  Pages: 779-798  DOI: 10.1080/01495730390219377  Published: AUG 2003   
Abstract: To prevent loss of viability in cryopreserved skin tissue, one of the most important issues is to understand the thermal stress induced by cryopreservation. During skin cryopreservation, which involves instantaneous heat transfer in small scale under cryogenic temperature, the thermal wave effect in heat conduction is expected to be critical for predicting phase change and related events in skin tissue. But up to now, little is known about phase change heat transfer considering a non-Fourier effect; and most of the existing attempts were based on the calculation in infinite domain; in particular, the thermal stress thus induced in the phase change process with non-Fourier effect has not been reported. In this study, the phase change behavior and the thermal stress inside the skin tissue subject to freezing were numerically investigated considering the non-Fourier effect. The results obtained from the hyperbolic heat conduction equation were compared with those obtained from the classical parabolic heat conduction equation. It was shown that results from the non-Fourier model and the traditional heat conduction equation are quite different in some cases and that the non-Fourier effect can be important when the thermal relaxation time of biomaterials is large. Without considering this effect, error and misinterpretation of the predicted temperature and thermal stress may result.
